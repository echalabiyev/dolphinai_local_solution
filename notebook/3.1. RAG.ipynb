      "Header Billing Plans in Periodic Billing Purpose\n",
      "A billing plan is a schedule of individual billing dates for a single item in a sales document.\n",
      "You can define a billing plan at header level, which is then valid for all items assigned to it.Depending on the kind of business process you are carrying out, the system can automatically propose one of two different types of billing plan: periodic or milestone billing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lease/contract Specified period Always 100 %\n",
      "• Periodic billing means billing a total amount for each individual billing date in the plan.\n",
      "For example, if you are creating a rental contract, the system can propose a schedule of monthly rental payments, according to the length and conditions of the contract.\n",
      "• Milestone billing means distributing the total amount to be billed over multiple billing dates in the billing plan.\n",
      "For example, you can use a billing plan for billing a make-toorder item that is assigned to a project in the SAP Project System.\n",
      "When you enter the project-related make-to-order item in the sales order (or assembly order), the system proposes a billing plan based on milestones defined for networks in the project.\n",
      "As each milestone is successfully reached, the customer is billed either a percentage of the entire project cost or simply a pre-defined amount.During sales order processing, the system determines from the item category whether a billing plan is required and, if so, which type of plan: periodic or milestone billing.\n",
      "The type of billing plan that is determined at this point is set up in Customizing and cannot be changed in the sales document.\n",
      "For each billing plan you create, you can enter a freely-definable search term in the details screen of the billing plan in the sales document.\n",
      "When you save the document, the system automatically assigns a number that later uniquely identifies the individual plan.\n",
      "You can use the search term later to locate specific billing plans.Billing plans for rental contracts and billing plans for project-related milestone billing have different overview screens so that you can enter data relevant to your processing.\n",
      "For example, for milestone billing, you must be able to enter data to identify the individual milestones.For more information about project milestones, see the Production Planning documentation about the Project System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocating/Loading Condition Records > Use\n",
      "To calculate the freight costs for shipments, you can store pricing conditions with up to three scales in the SAP System.\n",
      "To simplify handling and reduce the processing effort required, we have extended the function for allocating the price conditions in the current ALE scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "You can allocate multi-dimensional freight conditions from an SAP system to other systems using ALE.\n",
      "Here you can use the IDoc to copy conditions from an external system.\n",
      "You use the change transaction to initiate the transmission of a freight condition.\n",
      "You can select individual records for transmission from the list of conditions (through \"Condition Info\").For more information, refer to the section IDoc Tracing [Ext.\n",
      "]. Break-Weight Calculation > Use\n",
      "Break-weight calculation is required for several shipment contracts.\n",
      "In break-weight calculation, the system calculates at what weight onwards the price becomes cheaper, in order to get to a higher and more reasonable pricing scale level.You have agreed on shipment rates where at scale level 5 to 10 tons of weight to be shipped the price is 6 USD per 100 kg, and at scale level 10 to 15 tons of weight to be shipped the price is only 5 DM per 100 kg.\n",
      "These are “From” scales, that is, from 10 tons onwards, the system calculates the price according to the second scale level.\n",
      "So, if you have a shipment of 9 tons, the break-weight calculation is that the price is cheaper if 10 tons are charged (= 500 USD) rather than 9 tons (= 540 USD).\n",
      "The break weight is the weight starting from which it is cheaper to calculate 10 tons rather than the real weight.\n",
      "In this example, the break weight is between 8.3 and 8.4 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "During break-weight calculation, the use of two condition types is necessary.\n",
      "The first condition type is used for “standard” calculation of the shipment costs.\n",
      "The second condition type is used for calculation of the shipment costs at the next higher scale level.\n",
      "Now the system compares the two calculated values using a type of exclusion procedure and takes the most reasonable value as the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Activities\n",
      "You create the second condition type with a reference to the first condition type (can be set using the fields Reference condition type and Reference application).\n",
      "The second condition type, therefore, uses the same condition records as the first condition type.\n",
      "When you assign the scales, select the break-weight indicator only for the second condition type.\n",
      "This indicator has the effect that, when the shipment costs are calculated, the next higher scale level is used for the calculation.\n",
      "Therefore, two calculations take place: in the “standard” way” and at the next higher scale level.\n",
      "With multi-dimensional scales, you set the indicator in the scale where the break- weight is to be calculated (in the case of a condition type that contains a distance and weight scale, for example, you could set the indicator in the weight scale).\n",
      "When the shipment costs are calculated by the system, it compares the costs.\n",
      "For this purpose, you need to define a condition exclusion group, assign both condition types to the exclusion group, and then specify the exclusion procedure.\n",
      "The cheaper cost between the condition types.\n",
      "You then assign the exclusion procedure to your calculation procedure.\n",
      "If you wish to first consider the surcharges and discounts before you execute and compare the calculations, define two exclusion groups, assign a condition type plus surcharges and discounts to an exclusion group, and select the exclusion procedure The cheaper cost between the exclusion groups.Break-Weight Calculation Creating Shipment Cost Documents Online Creating Shipment Cost Documents Online > Prerequisites\n",
      "Before you create a shipment cost document, the following settings must be made in Customizing:� The number ranges must be defined for shipment costs.� The shipment cost types and item categories must be defined and assigned.� For each shipment type, you must define the relevance for shipment costs for header, leg, border crossing point and load transfer point.� You can assign shipment costs to the shipment cost types.\n",

      "These control elements include the overall status that the shipment must have before the shipment cost document can be created.6. If you want to override the pricing date and the settlement date that are determined automatically (depending on settings in Customizing) for every shipment cost item, you enter a pricing date and a settlement date here.The date that you enter here can still be overwritten at item level.\n",

      "If your goods qualify as originating, they could qualify for preferential duty treatment.\n",
      "When you export goods that qualify for preference, you pay little or no customs duties.For example, your company is located in the European Union (EU) and you export material X. If material X originates in your country or any other EU member-state, it qualifies for preference when you export it to customers in the EU.\n",
      "Therefore, you can export it duty free to these customers.This component stores preferences for each customs area in the purchasing info records and, using the bill of material, aggregates them to a general value in the material master record.\n",
      "In the future, it will be possible to store preferences for each customs area and material.\n",

      "Allocating/Loading Condition Records > Use\n",
      "To calculate the freight costs for shipments, you can store pricing conditions with up to three scales in the SAP System.\n",
      "To simplify handling and reduce the processing effort required, we have extended the function for allocating the price conditions in the current ALE scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "You can allocate multi-dimensional freight conditions from an SAP system to other systems using ALE.\n",
      "Here you can use the IDoc to copy conditions from an external system.\n",
      "You use the change transaction to initiate the transmission of a freight condition.\n",
      "You can select individual records for transmission from the list of conditions (through \"Condition Info\").For more information, refer to the section IDoc Tracing [Ext.\n",
      "]. Break-Weight Calculation > Use\n",
      "Break-weight calculation is required for several shipment contracts.\n",
      "In break-weight calculation, the system calculates at what weight onwards the price becomes cheaper, in order to get to a higher and more reasonable pricing scale level.You have agreed on shipment rates where at scale level 5 to 10 tons of weight to be shipped the price is 6 USD per 100 kg, and at scale level 10 to 15 tons of weight to be shipped the price is only 5 DM per 100 kg.\n",
      "These are “From” scales, that is, from 10 tons onwards, the system calculates the price according to the second scale level.\n",
      "So, if you have a shipment of 9 tons, the break-weight calculation is that the price is cheaper if 10 tons are charged (= 500 USD) rather than 9 tons (= 540 USD).\n",
      "The break weight is the weight starting from which it is cheaper to calculate 10 tons rather than the real weight.\n",
      "In this example, the break weight is between 8.3 and 8.4 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "During break-weight calculation, the use of two condition types is necessary.\n",
      "The first condition type is used for “standard” calculation of the shipment costs.\n",
      "The second condition type is used for calculation of the shipment costs at the next higher scale level.\n",
      "Now the system compares the two calculated values using a type of exclusion procedure and takes the most reasonable value as the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Activities\n",
      "You create the second condition type with a reference to the first condition type (can be set using the fields Reference condition type and Reference application).\n",
      "The second condition type, therefore, uses the same condition records as the first condition type.\n",
      "When you assign the scales, select the break-weight indicator only for the second condition type.\n",
      "This indicator has the effect that, when the shipment costs are calculated, the next higher scale level is used for the calculation.\n",
      "Therefore, two calculations take place: in the “standard” way” and at the next higher scale level.\n",
      "With multi-dimensional scales, you set the indicator in the scale where the break- weight is to be calculated (in the case of a condition type that contains a distance and weight scale, for example, you could set the indicator in the weight scale).\n",
      "When the shipment costs are calculated by the system, it compares the costs.\n",
      "For this purpose, you need to define a condition exclusion group, assign both condition types to the exclusion group, and then specify the exclusion procedure.\n",
      "The cheaper cost between the condition types.\n",
      "You then assign the exclusion procedure to your calculation procedure.\n",
      "If you wish to first consider the surcharges and discounts before you execute and compare the calculations, define two exclusion groups, assign a condition type plus surcharges and discounts to an exclusion group, and select the exclusion procedure The cheaper cost between the exclusion groups.Break-Weight Calculation Creating Shipment Cost Documents Online Creating Shipment Cost Documents Online > Prerequisites\n",
      "Before you create a shipment cost document, the following settings must be made in Customizing:• The number ranges must be defined for shipment costs.• The shipment cost types and item categories must be defined and assigned.• For each shipment type, you must define the relevance for shipment costs for header, leg, border crossing point and load transfer point.• You can assign shipment costs to the shipment cost types.\n",

If you have not defined default values in Customizing (see above, assignment to a shipment type) enter a shipment cost type.The shipment cost type contains control elements that allow different processing options for shipment cost documents.\n",
      "These control elements include the overall status that the shipment must have before the shipment cost document can be created.6. If you want to override the pricing date and the settlement date that are determined automatically (depending on settings in Customizing) for every shipment cost item, you enter a pricing date and a settlement date here.The date that you enter here can still be overwritten at item level.\n",

      "These cross selling articles are ones that pertain specifically to the purchased article.\n",
      "• If the order taker waits to press Enter until the customer has finished ordering, then the dialog box appears automatically, this time showing all of the articles in the sales order, along with their corresponding cross selling articles.The articles that appear in the cross selling dialog box always depend on which articles are in the sales order.\n",
      "If you want to have the system suggest articles based on the customer\\'s past purchasing history or other factors, see Dynamic Product Proposal [Page 119] in the standard SD documentation.The cross selling dialog box displays the following information:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross Selling\n",

      "You can set up the system so that if a customer orders a specific article, a list of other suggested articles appears as well.\n",
      "If the customer chooses to accept one of the suggested articles, the article is flagged in the sales transaction data indicating that this article was a result of cross selling.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prerequisites\n",
      "To set up cross selling, you must make the following settings in Customizing:\n",
      "• Create the conditions tables, access sequence, and calculation schemes for determining cross selling articles, since the cross selling function relies on the conditions technique.\n",

      " | FIGURE 3-7 | Scheduling agreement, shipping, billing, and requested delivery date details of a sales\n",
      " | document type The additional sales document type fields shown in Figure 3-7 are explained as follows:\n",
      " | • The scheduling agreement area is used by scheduling agreement document types. This will be covered in Chapter 4.\n",
      " | • The correction delivery type is used for scheduling agreements.\n",
      " | • The usage field is used to indicate on the sales order what the customer uses the material for. This entry will be copied into all items, or it may be placed into items individually in the sales order.\n",
      " | • MRP for delivery schedule type is used for scheduling agreements in order for them to set if the system should use just in time (JIT) processing or forward the demands on to material requirements planning (MRP).\n",
      " | • Delivery blocks can be automatically set for scheduling agreements. A blank entry indicates no delivery block.\n",
      " | By referring to the shipping section seen in Figure 3-7 we can see the following data:\n",
      " | • This is the standard shipping screen. It indicates that this document type is relevant for delivery, and the delivery type to be used for automatic processing is LF.\n",
      " | • There is no automatic delivery block entered in the sales order.\n",
      " | The shipping conditions are proposed by the customer master record. Should an entry have existed in this field, this entry would have taken precedence and overwritten those found on the customer master record. The shipping condition value is used to determine the shipping point. See Chapter 6 for information on shipping point determination.\n",
      " | • The immediate delivery indicator is not set. This flag creates a delivery immediately after saving the sales order. So for each sales order you create, the delivery is created automatically by the system. The delivery is not completed and the picking, packing (if relevant), and goods issue must still be carried out.\n",
      " | By referring to the billing section of the sales document type as seen in Figure 3-7, we can see the following data:\n",
      " | • This document is relevant for invoicing and for delivery-related invoicing, the system automatically uses invoice document type F2.\n",
      " | • When an order-related invoice is possible the system will use document type F2 for automatic processing as well. (This makes sense if you wish your order and delivery relevant products to be invoiced at the same time.) The inter-company billing document type for automatic processing is IV.\n",
      " | • There is no automatic posting of a billing block on the sales order. It may be necessary, however, to have a billing block for credit notes, which we will look at later in this chapter.\n",
      " | This means that the order cannot be billed until the billing block is removed. Using a billing block is a safety feature. For example, you may have a background job that creates invoices. When you save the order, this background job will see the order and then invoice it if it is for order-related billing. Using the billing block will prevent this from happening until the order has been checked and the billing block explicitly removed. The condition type for line items is used to determine the costing of the line item; it must be equal to the condition type allocated on your pricing procedure.\n",
      " | • The billing plan type is either periodic billing, where the entire value to be billed to date is billed in full on the billing plan date (for example, a rental agreement), or milestone billing, where the total value to be billed is distributed between the individual billing plan dates (for example, for a project based on project milestones, where the value billed on each date can be a fixed amount or a percentage).\n",
      " | • Payment guarantee procedure indicates to the system what form of guarantee procedure to use for this sales document. These are risk management. For more information, see credit management Chapter 10.\n",
      " | • Payment card plan type is an essential setting should you want your system to accept payment cards in the sales order process.\n",
      " | • Checking group is used to determin e how the system carries out the checking of payment card data.\n",
      " | By referring to Figure 3-7 you may see the settings that affect the requested delivery date:\n",
      " | • Lead time in days is the requested delivery date in the sales order. It is recommended this be left as a zero in most instances.\n",
      " | • The propose delivery date checkbox is checked to propose the current date as the delivery date.\n",
      " | • Date type allows the user to set the format of the delivery schedule line date for internal system use—for example, date, week, month, etc.\n",
      " | • Proposal for pricing date allows you to specify the valid-from date for the pricing of the reference document, or the requested delivery date, or the current date.\n",
      " | • Propose valid-from date allows you to determine when the valid-from date for pricing should be. This is used, for example, in quotations.\n",
      " | • Propose PO date proposes the current date as purchase order date.\n",
      " | Figure 3-8 is the final portion of the configuration settings of the sales document. It refers to the contract and availability check:\n",
      " | • Pricing procedure conditions at header level refers to contract conditions. (Refer to contracts in Chapter 4.)\n",
      " | • Pricing procedure conditions at item level refers to contract conditions. (Refer to contracts in Chapter 4.)\n",
      " | • Contract profile is a default setting that will propose default data such as validity dates into the contract you are creating. (Refer to Contract profiles in Chapter 4.)\n",
      " | • Billing request is also associated with contracts. (Refer to contracts in Chapter 4.)\n",
      " | • Group reference procedure is used for master contracts to determine which data is to be copied or proposed into lower-level contracts. The referencing procedures are configured with master contracts later in this chapter.\n",
      " | Copyright by SAP AG\n",
      " | FIGURE 3-8 Contract and availability check details\n",
      " | Contract data allowed controls what data is to be copied over contract item data from header contract data. If you do not want contract data for this sales document type, leave the field blank.\n",
      " | • Follow up activity type is used to initiate and assist in the speedy creation of a sales activity work list, such as a follow-up phone call or a follow-up sales letter.\n",
      " | • A subsequent order type is assigned here should you define a follow-up action for the contract. For example, if you wish your contract to create a quotation for a new contract one week before the contract end date, you would specify what type of quotation document type (e.g., AG) that would be.\n",
      " | • The check partner authority field is used by the system to check the partner type creating a release order against the contract. Only those partners with the partner function AG (Sold-to Party) or AA (Sold-to Party for release orders) as well as higher-level partners in a hierarchy are allowed to create release orders.\n",
      " | • The update lower-level contracts field is used by the system to update lower-level contracts, should the data you are changing be the master contract. These changes are then passed down to the lower-level contracts via workflow. Should this field not be checked, the system will only update the lower-level contract when it is re-processed.\n",
      " | • The business transaction for ATP field is used by the system to signal that communication must take place with the APO system to determine the ATP of this sales document type.\n",
      " | NOTE ATP means “available to promise” and refers to when the business will be able to supply the goods being ordered—that is, when will procurement and production have the goods ready for shipping to the customer, preferably by the customer’s requested delivery date.\n",
      " | NOTE APO is the Advanced Planner and Optimizer, an additional software component offered by SAP to allow a business to plan procurement and production.\n",
      " | Assignment of Sales Areas to Sales Documents\n",
      " | If the sales document types you created are permitted to be used by all sales areas, there is no need to create settings here. However, there may be a need to assign sales documents to specific sales areas—for example, if a unique sales document type is used for all sales orders from a specific sales organization.\n",

      " | Documents | Sales Document Header | Assign Sales Area To Sales Document Types [OVAZ] You may assign reference sales organizations as well as reference distribution channels and divisions. Do not confuse this referencing with the assignment of common distribution channels and common divisions. The referencing done here is only used by the system to determine which sales documents are permitted for which sales areas. If all sales document types are allowed for use by all sales areas, leave the assignment fields blank.\n",
      " | Creating Order Reasons for Sales Documents\n",
      " | You can create order reasons as to why a customer is purchasing or using a sales document. This is helpful in determining the trigger which creates the sales order, which in turn may be useful for analysis on order entry. The order reason can be “sales call” or “good price” or while processing returns can be “poor quality” or “material damaged.”\n",
      " | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Sales |\n",
      " | Sales Documents | Sales Document Header | Define Order Reasons [OVAU]\n",
      " | You create the order reasons for the business, for the standard sales order cycle as well as the returns cycle and any other sales processes. The order reason may be used for the logistics information system (LIS), thus you may report on or use this field in a matrix for sales information.\n",
      " | Should the order reason be a crucial field for your reporting, you can assign it to an incompletion log for the particular sales order to ensure no sales order may be saved or further processed until the order reason has been completed. For more information on incompletion logs see Chapter 4.\n",
      " | Defining Purchase Order Types for Sales Documents\n",
      " | This is particularly useful for sales analyses. One is able to create a default list of order reasons to enable order capturing to determine whether the sales document originated from a telephone call or mail shot, or even to indicate the sale originated from the Internet.\n",
      " | This is a useful grouping term, as seen in Figure 3-9.\n",
      " | Sales Order Item Categories and Determination\n",
      " | The sales item category is one of the most important fields in the SAP sales order. It controls the sales document flow and also impacts the schedule line category. The item category of the sales order affects the delivery and finally impacts the billing process as well. Keeping to our basic sales flow, we will look at the integration of the item category into the following document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\n",
      " | Defining Item Categories\n",
      " | Unlike the sales document type, which is entered manually into the sales order at order creation, the item category is automatically determined by the system. It is then able to be changed manually in the sales document, if required.\n",

Then click the Copy button, and change the key to begin with a Y or a Z. As in the sales document type creation, you will be prompted with a dialog box (as seen in the next illustration) asking if this item is valid for copy control. Select Yes to ensure the same copy rules in existence for the item you used as a reference will be replicated for your new item category.\n",

      "Thus, customer requirements for these materials are consumed by the independent requirements of the planning material.\n",

      "You must also enter the appropriate strategy group for planning using planning materials on the MRP 3 screen.You are not able to perform a transfer of requirements from the sales or delivery documents when using a planning material.\n",
      "Rather, the actual requirement from the order or delivery consumes the independent requirement of the planning material.\n",
      "The independent requirement is thus reduced.\n",
      "Then when MRP is run, requirements are created for the order or delivery, and for the balance of the independent requirement.\n",
      "For example, with an independent requirement of 100 tons and an order of 20 tons, the order becomes a requirement of 20 tons, and the independent requirement is reduced to 80 tons.\n",
      "The total requirement is still 100 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stock Requirements List\n",

      "It is accessed via various menu paths, but the simplest menu path is as follows.\n",

In both cases, the procurement element is created directly from the sales order (the purchase requisition in the case of the third-party order processing and the production order, planned order, or the like in the case of the assembly processing).\n",
      " | The credit block in the sales order prevents the creation of the procurement element. However if the credit block is first set during the change of a sales order, the procurement element is deleted again. As long as the credit block is set in the sales order, no procurement or production occurs for this sales order. If a sales order is released from the credit block, an availability check is carried out again for this order. The availability check tries to confirm the requested quantities. In case of the direct procurement, a purchase requisition or a production order is created again in the background.\n",
      " | It is possible in some instances that the subsequent operations and purchase requisitions that have been used may not have been deleted. For example, in a service order, they may have simply been locked, as all processes should be on hold due to the credit block. When the document is released, a new document (for example, a new service order) may be created to continue the process. The first service order and the new service order now relate to a single sales document. (If you are interested, service documents would be obtainable from transaction code [IW39] - List of All Service Orders.)\n",
      " | Availability Check\n",
      " | The availability check forms an integral part of the business sales process. It determines if the requested delivery quantity can be available for shipping in order to meet the customer’s requested delivery date.\n",
      " | The availability check is carried out at a Plant level. It results in a material availability date. This represents the date the system has determined the requested material will be available. Added to this date is the pick pack time, the loading time, and the transportation scheduling time, which may or may not be added, depending on how long it is. All of these dates result in a planned goods issue date, which is the planned date the goods are transferred from the business’ ownership and control, possibly to a shipping agent. The shipping dates are then added to the goods issue date, resulting in a delivery date. This automatically determined delivery date is then communicated to the customer when the sales order is placed.\n",
      " | Terminology Used in the Availability Check\n",
      " | Backorder processing is the processing of a backorder, which in itself is a sales order that has not been confirmed in full or not confirmed at a certain delivery date.\n",
      " | Rescheduling is a proposal of how confirmed quantities already assigned to sales orders may be reassigned to other orders that have a higher priority—for example, an earlier requested delivery date.\n",
      " | ATP is an acronym for “availability to promise,” which is the basis of the availability check. The system is able to automatically calculate the available quantity to promise or commit to a sales document based upon a number of rules that we shall define later.\n",
      " | ATP takes into account all movements into and out of the warehouse.\n",
      " | The stock examined for ATP may be safety stock, stock in transfer, stock in quality inspection, and blocked stock. The planned receipts and planned issues of the stock associated with ATP may be purchase orders, purchase requisitions, planned orders, production orders, reservations, dependent reservations, dependent requirements, sales requirements, and delivery requirements.\n",
      " | If the business produces special stock, such as made-to-order goods or consignment stock, the ATP check may be carried out against the special stock.\n",
      " | Replenishment lead time is the time needed to produce the requested stock. It can comprise the time taken by the business to produce a material or the time taken to ex ternally procure the material from a vendor. This includes the goods receipting time. Thus the replenishment lead time is the time taken for the material to become available. Replenishment lead time is only used when doing an ATP check.\n",
      " | The value of the replenishment lead time for a material is specified on the material master record. It may be determined in one of two ways:\n",
      " | • The replenishment lead time for an externally procured material is determined based on the total of the processing time for purchasing, the planned delivery time, and the goods receipt processing time. These settings may be made on the Purchasing and MRP 2 views of the material master record.\n",
      " | • The replenishment lead time for an internally procured material is based on the in-house production time, seen on the MRP 2 view as well as the goods receipt processing time, or alternatively if set, from the total replenishment lead time, which is found in the material master record on the MRP 3 view.\n",
      " | If a sales order is created and there is no available stock and the ATP check is set to include replenishment lead time, the system will automatically confirm the desired quantity for the end of replenishment lead time based on whether the material is externally or internally procured. Thus should you have an order for 100,000 pieces of material xyz and the system has no available stock, it will still give a confirmed date according to the end of the lead time. Should there be partial stock available, the system will confirm this partial quantity and move the remaining quantity to the end of replenishment lead time. It does not do an availability check outside of the replenishment lead time. If replenishment lead time is three days for a specific material, it will not do an availability check outside of those three days as it automatically thinks it will definitely have stock on the fourth day. To examine stock on hand you may use the availability overview, proceed with the menu path.\n",

      " | • The availability check on the basis of the ATP quantities as previously described.\n",
      " | • The availability check against product allocation, with which one is able to do an availability check against product allocation, allowing a predefined distribution quantity of products to customers.\n",
      " | • The third availability check takes place in the stand-alone APO (Advanced Planner and Optimizer) planning system from SAP.\n",
      " | Basic Elements of the Availability Check\n",
      " | We now have enough background into the availability process to configure the logic behind ATP.\n",
      " | Checking Groups\n",
      " | The checking group defines what type of requirements we will pass on. Do we record summarized requirements—that is, daily or weekly summed up requirements in the stock requirements list? Or do we record individual requirements—that is, a line for each sales order and line item and schedule line in the stock requirement list? The advantages of individual requirements over summarized requirements are as follows:\n",
      " | • Backorder processing is possible for individual processing.\n",
      " | • We can access the order and line items and schedule lines in the stock requirements list [MD04]. This gives one greater control over the available stock and the requirements placed on the stock.\n",
      " | The disadvantages are • There may be slightly more impact on system performance as each demand is placed immediately into the stock requirements list.\n",
      " | Do not forget the system automatically uses individual requirements for special stock movements such as consignment stock, returnable packaging, etc., even if summarized requirements have been selected.\n",
      " | The checking groups are configurable. However, SAP standard uses  the following checking groups:\n",
      " | • 01 to represent daily requirements\n",
      " | • 02 to represent individual requirements\n",
      " | The checking group plus the checking rule determine how the availability check is to be performed.

In controlling the availability check at the time of the sales order, a purchase requisition for a line item does not necessarily indicate that the stock requested is going to come into the plant. A shipping notification, which is a confirmed purchase order, on the other hand, is a good indicator you will be receiving stock on a certain date. Should you select shipping notifications as an element for the availability check in the sales order, be careful if selecting it for the delivery. As you may discover, you actually did not receive the stock and may be creating a delivery with no materials in the plant or warehouse. Both sales and delivery requirements are taken into account in the availability check in sales documents. However, in delivery document ATP checks, only the delivery requirements are taken into account, so there is a danger that quantities reserved in the sales documents are considered to be available by the availability check in the deliveries, resulting in the deliveries being created and the material availability dates of the materials in the sales documents being pushed out.\n",

      "\n",
      "Check on the Basis of the ATP Quantities\n",
      "The ATP quantity (ATP = Available To Promise) is calculated from the warehouse stock, the planned inward movements of stock (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders) and the planned outward movements of stock (sales orders, deliveries, reservations).\n",
      "This type of check is performed dynamically for each transaction, taking into account the relevant stock and planned goods movements with or without replenishment lead time.\n",

      "Check against Product Allocation\n",
      "Product allocation facilitates period-based distribution of products for certain customers or regions.\n",
      "As of Release 3.0F, you can carry out an availability check against product allocation.\n",
      "This ensures, for example, that when production is low, the first customer does not get the full amount, resulting in following sales orders not being confirmed or being confirmed far too late.\n",

      "\n",
      "Check against planning\n",
      "The check against planning is performed against independent requirements which are usually created for an ‘anonymous’ market rather than being customer-specific (for example, in the strategy ‘Planning without assembly’, when production occurs only up to the stocking level).\n",

      "The system determines replenishment lead time according to specific times defined by you in the material master record.\n",
      "Depending on the material type, replenishment lead time can be calculated according to various time periods.\n",
      "In the case of trading goods, for example, it is determined according to the planned delivery time, purchasing processing time, and the goods receipt processing time.\n",
      "Replenishment lead time is only included in the check performed on the basis of the ATP quantity.\n",

      "Availability Check Including Replenishment Time\n",
      "Availability is only checked up to the end of replenishment lead time.\n",
      "If the material availability date is calculated on the basis of the current date to lie after the replenishment lead time for the item, the item itself can be confirmed despite insufficient stock being available.\n",
      "In this case, the system assumes that any quantity requested by the customer can be procured by the material availability date and considers the goods to be available.\n",
      "Therefore, a binding confirmation can be sent to the customer.\n",
      "The following figure shows such a case.\n",
      "The customer wants 20 pieces delivered in full by the requested delivery date.\n",
      "Using backward scheduling, the system determines a material availability date.\n",

      "The customer wants complete delivery.\n",
      "However, as a result of further inward (50 pieces) and outward stock movements (40 pieces), the goods only become available shortly before the requested delivery date specified by the customer when 60 pieces are added to the stock.\n",
      "Correspondingly, the delivery date resulting from this material availability date would lie further in the future.However, since replenishment lead time is taken into account during the availability check, the 20 pieces ordered can be delivered before this date, namely at the end of the replenishment lead time.Inward movementtoday\n",

      "• Strategy groupThe allowed planning strategies (main strategy and further possible strategies) are combined in the strategy group.\n",
      "As of Release 3.0, the strategy group is specified in the material master record in the MRP 1 Screen.\n",
      "In Customizing, strategy groups are assigned, dependent on plant, to MRP groups.\n",
      "If the strategy group is missing in the material master record, it is determined on the basis of the MRP group, if it has been maintained.Up to Release 3.0, the strategy group is determined on the basis of the MRP group • MRP groupThe MRP group combines materials from the point of view of material requirements planning.\n",
      "This enables you to control planning for these materials in a particular way using, for example, the strategy group, consumption mode and planning period.\n",
      "You enter the MRP group in the material master in the MRP 1 screen.\n",
      "The strategy group is determined from the MRP group.• Planning StrategyThe planning strategy specifies the requirements type for planning and customer requirements.\n",
      "This represents the decisive control feature for the interaction between Production Planning and Sales and Distribution.• MRP type and item categoryIf no requirements type is found using the planning strategy, the system tries to determine a corresponding requirements type on the basis of the MRP type and the item category.Until 3.0C, determination of the requirements type via planning strategy has taken priority.\n",
      "This is not always the best option, however, as the following example will show.\n",
      "A requirements type is determined for a material, which causes availability to be checked against planning.\n",
      "In consignment stock processing, however, availability should be checked against stock.\n",
      "Until 3.0C the availability check had to be deactivated in these cases.\n",
      "As of Release 3.0C, you can determine how the requirements type is to be determined for each transaction by maintaining the Source field in Determination of requirement types using transaction in Customizing.• Requirements type\n",
      "\n",

      "The various requirements are identified by their requirements type.\n",

      "• Requirements ClassThe requirements class contains all control features for planning such as relevance for planning, requirements planning strategy and requirements consumption strategy.\n",
      "In addition, it is specified at a global level whether an availability check is to take place for the material in the sales and distribution documents on the basis of the ATP quantity (ATP = available to promise) and whether requirements are to be passed on.\n",

      "In addition, a material block for the availability check with transfer of requirements can be set here.\n",
      "The checking group can also be used to deactivate the availability check.\n",
      "This option was created especially for the assembly order so that when the bill of material is exploded in the assembly order, the individual components, if necessary, can be classified as non-critical parts as far as procurement is concerned.The checking group specifies in combination with the checking rule the scope of the availability check.\n",
      "It is proposed in the material master record on the basis of the material type and the plant, and copied into the sales and distribution documents.• Checking RuleYou use the checking rule to control the scope of the availability check for each transaction in sales and distribution.\n",
      "You also specify whether the check should be carried out including or excluding replenishment lead time.\n",
      "The individual checking rules define by transaction, which stock and inward and outward movement of goods should be taken into account for the availability check.• Schedule line categoryYou can control with the schedule line category whether an availability check and transfer of requirements should be carried out in the sales documents.\n",
      "The possible settings for this at schedule line level are dependent on the settings in the requirements class which is determined from the requirements type of the material.• Delivery item categoryThe delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes place in deliveries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Blocking Logic\n",
      "There are two blocking concepts:\n",
      "• Material blockIn Customizing, the Define material block for other users, step is used to determine, by checking group and transaction (order/delivery), whether a material master record should be blocked for other users during an availability check.\n",
      "The block is set at material-plant level and remains in place until you save the sales document.• Material block with quantity transferFor performance-related reasons, the only time when it makes sense to set the material block with quantity transfer is when it is common for several users to work on the same material simultaneously.\n",
      "If this is not the case in your organization, you can work with the conventional blocking logic at material-plant level.In Customizing, the material block can be set with quantity transfer under Define checking group.\n",
      "If this block is active, the material is blocked only for the duration of the availability check when you create or change a sales and distribution document.\n",
      "Thus, it is possible for several users to process the same material simultaneously in various transactions without blocking each other.\n",
      "During the availability check, the material being used is blocked exclusively in the current plant as in a conventional block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\n",
      "If another user tries to process the blocked material in the corresponding plant while the availability check is being carried out, the system tries five times to block the material exclusively for this other transaction with a pause of about 1 second between each attempt.\n",
      "If the fifth attempt is unsuccessful, the check is terminated and the transaction remains unconfirmed.\n",
      "To confirm the transaction, the user must call up the availability check again.\n",
      "After completion of the check, the corresponding confirmed quantities are still blocked, but not exclusively.\n",
      "The material block is removed.\n",
      "The non-exclusive quantity block then supplies information to users working in other transactions, on the reserved quantities of the corresponding material being processed in the selected plant.\n",
      "The block entries are removed when processing is completed.\n",
      "If the transaction processed was saved, then the block entries were only removed after the relevant changes to the data base have been carried out.You create a sales order for a material.\n",
      "During the availability check, this material is blocked.\n",
      "After the availability check is completed, the block is removed.\n",
      "The quantity reserved for this transaction is recorded in the blocking table.\n",
      "This information can be assessed by all others who are working with this material.\n",
      "If you save the order, the blocked entries are cancelled.During manual backorder processing, a material with a quantity block is blocked exclusively so that an availability check for this material is no longer possible.If both of the blocking options are active, the block with quantity transfer takes precedence. Scope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\n",
      "The following elements can be included in the availability check: | • | Stock − | safety stock\n",

      " |  | − | delivery requirements\n",
      " | Requirements in sales and distribution (sales requirements and delivery requirements) result from all transactions which forward a requirement to Materials Management (MM) or to Production Planning (PP). For example, this could include sales orders or deliveries and quotations as well. Sales and distribution requirements reduce existing stock or inward movements of stock on the material availability date to ensure that other outward movement of stock elements cannot access the quantity reserved in this way.\n",
      "Requirements relevant for Sales and distribution are created in Sales and Distribution, whereas other elements in this list are created in Materials Management or in Production Planning.For further information on transfer of requirements, see Requirements in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 37].\n",

      "Defining the Elements to be Included in Check\n",
      "A checking rule is assigned to each transaction.\n",
      "This rule in combination with the checking group controls the scope of the availability check.\n",
      "You can use the checking rules in Customizing for Sales to specify for the various transactions which of the elements listed above should be included in the availability check.\n",
      "For trading goods it does not make sense to include planned or production orders, for example, in the availability check.\n",
      "However, for products manufactured by your company these orders should be included in the check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\n",
