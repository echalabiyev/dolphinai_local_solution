      "Individual requirements are, as the name implies, an individual transference of demand to MRP for each schedule line.\n",

      "The strategy group may be found on the material master (transaction code [MM02]) MRP 3 view under planning.For the transfer of requirements to be carried out, you need to ensure a few criteria are met:• A plant must be assigned to the sales document line item level.• The schedule line category must be switched on for transfer of requirements.• The transfer of requirements must be switched on at the requirements class level.• A checking group must be defined and allocated to the material master record in the Sales: General/Plant view in the availability check field.When the transfer of requirements is switched on at requirements class level, it can be switched off at schedule line level.\n",
      "However, you cannot switch on the transfer of requirements at schedule line level if it is switched off at requirements class level.\n",

      "It is possible to create a common planning material and assign similar materials to it.\n",
      "Independent requirements are created for the planning material to cover the requirements that are expected for the materials assigned to the planning material.\n",
      "Thus, customer requirements for these materials are consumed by the independent requirements of the planning material.\n",
      "This means that you do not have to create independent requirements for each material.\n",
      "You assign the planning material to the materials on the MRP 3 screen.\n",
      "You must also enter the appropriate strategy group for planning using planning materials on the MRP 3 screen.You are not able to perform a transfer of requirements from the sales or delivery documents when using a planning material.\n",
      "Rather, the actual requirement from the order or delivery consumes the independent requirement of the planning material.\n",
      "The independent requirement is thus reduced.\n",
      "Then when MRP is run, requirements are created for the order or delivery, and for the balance of the independent requirement.\n",
      "For example, with an independent requirement of 100 tons and an order of 20 tons, the order becomes a requirement of 20 tons, and the independent requirement is reduced to 80 tons.\n",
      "The total requirement is still 100 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stock Requirements List\n",
      "The stock requirements list is the central table to planning and stock control.\n",
      "It is accessed via various menu paths, but the simplest menu path is as follows.\n",
      " s not stop this process. The third-party order processing and the assembly processing is referred to as direct procurement. In both cases, the procurement element is created directly from the sales order (the purchase requisition in the case of the third-party order processing and the production order, planned order, or the like in the case of the assembly processing).\n",
      " | The credit block in the sales order prevents the creation of the procurement element. However if the credit block is first set during the change of a sales order, the procurement element is deleted again. As long as the credit block is set in the sales order, no procurement or production occurs for this sales order. If a sales order is released from the credit block, an availability check is carried out again for this order. The availability check tries to confirm the requested quantities. In case of the direct procurement, a purchase requisition or a production order is created again in the background.\n",
      " | It is possible in some instances that the subsequent operations and purchase requisitions that have been used may not have been deleted. For example, in a service order, they may have simply been locked, as all processes should be on hold due to the credit block. When the document is released, a new document (for example, a new service order) may be created to continue the process. The first service order and the new service order now relate to a single sales document. (If you are interested, service documents would be obtainable from transaction code [IW39] - List of All Service Orders.)\n",
      " | Availability Check\n",
      " | The availability check forms an integral part of the business sales process. It determines if the requested delivery quantity can be available for shipping in order to meet the customer’s requested delivery date.\n",
      " | The availability check is carried out at a Plant level. It results in a material availability date. This represents the date the system has determined the requested material will be available. Added to this date is the pick pack time, the loading time, and the transportation scheduling time, which may or may not be added, depending on how long it is. All of these dates result in a planned goods issue date, which is the planned date the goods are transferred from the business’ ownership and control, possibly to a shipping agent. The shipping dates are then added to the goods issue date, resulting in a delivery date. This automatically determined delivery date is then communicated to the customer when the sales order is placed.\n",
      " | Terminology Used in the Availability Check\n",
      " | Backorder processing is the processing of a backorder, which in itself is a sales order that has not been confirmed in full or not confirmed at a certain delivery date.\n",
      " | Rescheduling is a proposal of how confirmed quantities already assigned to sales orders may be reassigned to other orders that have a higher priority—for example, an earlier requested delivery date.\n",
      " | ATP is an acronym for “availability to promise,” which is the basis of the availability check. The system is able to automatically calculate the available quantity to promise or commit to a sales document based upon a number of rules that we shall define later.\n",
      " | ATP takes into account all movements into and out of the warehouse.\n",
      " | The stock examined for ATP may be safety stock, stock in transfer, stock in quality inspection, and blocked stock. The planned receipts and planned issues of the stock associated with ATP may be purchase orders, purchase requisitions, planned orders, production orders, reservations, dependent reservations, dependent requirements, sales requirements, and delivery requirements.\n",
      " | If the business produces special stock, such as made-to-order goods or consignment stock, the ATP check may be carried out against the special stock.\n",
      " | Replenishment lead time is the time needed to produce the requested stock. It can comprise the time taken by the business to produce a material or the time taken to ex ternally procure the material from a vendor. This includes the goods receipting time. Thus the replenishment lead time is the time taken for the material to become available. Replenishment lead time is only used when doing an ATP check.\n",
      " | The value of the replenishment lead time for a material is specified on the material master record. It may be determined in one of two ways:\n",
      " | • The replenishment lead time for an externally procured material is determined based on the total of the processing time for purchasing, the planned delivery time, and the goods receipt processing time. These settings may be made on the Purchasing and MRP 2 views of the material master record.\n",
      " | • The replenishment lead time for an internally procured material is based on the in-house production time, seen on the MRP 2 view as well as the goods receipt processing time, or alternatively if set, from the total replenishment lead time, which is found in the material master record on the MRP 3 view.\n",
      " | If a sales order is created and there is no available stock and the ATP check is set to include replenishment lead time, the system will automatically confirm the desired quantity for the end of replenishment lead time based on whether the material is externally or internally procured. Thus should you have an order for 100,000 pieces of material xyz and the system has no available stock, it will still give a confirmed date according to the end of the lead time. Should there be partial stock available, the system will confirm this partial quantity and move the remaining quantity to the end of replenishment lead time. It does not do an availability check outside of the replenishment lead time. If replenishment lead time is three days for a specific material, it will not do an availability check outside of those three days as it automatically thinks it will definitely have stock on the fourth day. To examine stock on hand you may use the availability overview, proceed with the menu path.\n",

      " | • The availability check on the basis of the ATP quantities as previously described.\n",
      " | • The availability check against product allocation, with which one is able to do an availability check against product allocation, allowing a predefined distribution quantity of products to customers.\n",
      " | • The third availability check takes place in the stand-alone APO (Advanced Planner and Optimizer) planning system from SAP.\n",
      " | Basic Elements of the Availability Check\n",
      " | We now have enough background into the availability process to configure the logic behind ATP.\n",
      " | Checking Groups\n",
      " | The checking group defines what type of requirements we will pass on. Do we record summarized requirements—that is, daily or weekly summed up requirements in the stock requirements list? Or do we record individual requirements—that is, a line for each sales order and line item and schedule line in the stock requirement list? The advantages of individual requirements over summarized requirements are as follows:\n",
      " | • Backorder processing is possible for individual processing.\n",
      " | • We can access the order and line items and schedule lines in the stock requirements list [MD04]. This gives one greater control over the available stock and the requirements placed on the stock.\n",
      " | The disadvantages are • There may be slightly more impact on system performance as each demand is placed immediately into the stock requirements list.\n",
      " | Do not forget the system automatically uses individual requirements for special stock movements such as consignment stock, returnable packaging, etc., even if summarized requirements have been selected.\n",
      " | The checking groups are configurable. However, SAP standard uses  the following checking groups:\n",
      " | • 01 to represent daily requirements\n",
      " | • 02 to represent individual requirements\n",
      " | The checking group plus the checking rule determine how the availability check is to be performed. The availability check (field - MARC-MTVFP) used to be called the checking group for example in SAP R/3 4.0 and is now called “Availability check” in mySAP ERP ECC is found on the material master record on the MRP 3 view.\n",
      " | Checking Rule\n",
      " | The checking rule is used to control the scope of the availability check for each transaction in sales and distribution. The control of the availability check is defined by the checking group on the material master record and the checking rule representing the transaction.\n",
      " | Schedule Line Category\n",
      " | The availability check may be fine-tuned at the schedule line level, in the same way as the transfer of requirements was carried out at the schedule line level. Those schedule lines that are not relevant for availability check may be switched off at schedule line level by ensuring the availability check indicator is not flagged.\n",
      " | Delivery Item Category\n",
      " | The delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes place in deliveries. This setting in the availability check is used to switch the availability check off in deliveries.\n",
      " | Requirements Class\n",
      " | The requirements class as used in the transfer of requirements controls the relevance for planning, requirements planning strategy, and requirements consumption strategy. It is also responsible to determine if an availability check is to be performed for the material on the basis of the ATP quantity and whether the transfer of requirements is passed on.\n",
      " | Requirements Type\n",
      " | The requirements type refers to the requirements class and its features. The requirements class is assigned to the requirements type in the transfer of requirements.\n",

      " | In order for the availability check to be carried out, the following data, in addition to the configuration entries, described later, must be defined in the system:\n",
      " | • The availability check must be switched on at requirements class level. Refer to the transfer of requirements configuration process (transaction code [OVZG]). See Figure 5-26.\n",

      "The block is set at material-plant level and remains in place until you save the sales document.• Material block with quantity transferFor performance-related reasons, the only time when it makes sense to set the material block with quantity transfer is when it is common for several users to work on the same material simultaneously.\n",
