       "   'content': 'The SAP partner determination in SD works as follows:\\n\\nThe system checks the conditions set up in Customizing, such as access sequence, output type, schema, and application, to determine the trading partner. The condition components are evaluated in the specified order until a match is found.\\n\\nFor outbound EDI messages, the transmission medium must be set to 6 (EDI) and the output type must be SEDI or a modified copy of it. The access sequence should be 0001, and the output type must match the one specified in the condition component.\\n\\nThe system also checks the partner function, which can be CR (Carrier) or SH (Ship-to party), and the port, which should be SUBSYSTEM. Additionally, the output mode must be set to Collect IDocs, and the basic type should be SHPMNT03.\\n\\nFor inbound EDI messages, a similar process takes place, but with different condition components such as access sequence, output type, schema, and application. The transmission medium must also be set to 6 (EDI), and the output type must match the one specified in the condition component.\\n\\nThe system uses these conditions to determine the trading partner and performs the necessary processing based on the EDI settings configured in Customizing. This ensures that EDI messages are correctly routed and processed between trading partners.\\n\\nIn the case of a shipment document, the system triggers the EDI message immediately after posting (time 4) or when explicitly requested (time 3). The same applies to the scenario where the shipper informs the customer about the upcoming shipment.\\n\\nThe partner determination in SD is designed to handle various scenarios and settings for outbound and inbound EDI messages. By configuring the conditions correctly, the system can accurately determine the trading partner and perform the necessary processing, improving overall efficiency and accuracy.',\n",

       "   'content': 'The SAP partner determination in SD works as follows:\\n\\nThe system checks the conditions set up in Customizing, such as access sequence, output type, schema, and application, to determine the trading partner. The condition components are evaluated in the specified order until a match is found.\\n\\nFor outbound EDI messages, the transmission medium must be set to 6 (EDI) and the output type must be SEDI or a modified copy of it. The access sequence should be 0001, and the output type must match the one specified in the condition component.\\n\\nThe system also checks the partner function, which can be CR (Carrier) or SH (Ship-to party), and the port, which should be SUBSYSTEM. Additionally, the output mode must be set to Collect IDocs, and the basic type should be SHPMNT03.\\n\\nFor inbound EDI messages, a similar process takes place, but with different condition components such as access sequence, output type, schema, and application. The transmission medium must also be set to 6 (EDI), and the output type must match the one specified in the condition component.\\n\\nThe system uses these conditions to determine the trading partner and performs the necessary processing based on the EDI settings configured in Customizing. This ensures that EDI messages are correctly routed and processed between trading partners.\\n\\nIn the case of a shipment document, the system triggers the EDI message immediately after posting (time 4) or when explicitly requested (time 3). The same applies to the scenario where the shipper informs the customer about the upcoming shipment.\\n\\nThe partner determination in SD is designed to handle various scenarios and settings for outbound and inbound EDI messages. By configuring the conditions correctly, the system can accurately determine the trading partner and perform the necessary processing, improving overall efficiency and accuracy.',\n",
