      "FT uses the data in the master records in import/receipt and export/dispatch processes both directly and indirectly in these components. It uses the data directly as default values in MM purchase orders, advanced shipping notifications (inbound deliveries), goods receipts and in SD outbound deliveries and billing documents.
