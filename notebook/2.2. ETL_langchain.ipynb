Control Features\\nThe following control elements need to be maintained in Customizing and in the material master record:\\n• Strategy groupThe allowed planning strategies (main strategy and further possible strategies) are combined in the strategy group.\\nAs of Release 3.0, the strategy group is specified in the material master record in the MRP 1 Screen.\\nIn Customizing, strategy groups are assigned, dependent on plant, to MRP groups.\\nIf the strategy group is missing in the material master record, it is determined on the basis of the MRP group, if it has been maintained.Up to Release 3.0, the strategy group is determined on the basis of the MRP group • MRP groupThe MRP group combines materials from the point of view of material requirements planning.\\nThis enables you to control planning for these materials in a particular way using, for example, the strategy group, consumption mode and planning period.\\nYou enter the MRP group in the material master in the MRP 1 screen.\\nThe strategy group is determined from the MRP group.• Planning StrategyThe planning strategy specifies the requirements type for planning and customer requirements.\\nThis represents the decisive control feature for the interaction between Production Planning and Sales and Distribution.• MRP type and item categoryIf no requirements type is found using the planning strategy, the system tries to determine a corresponding requirements type on the basis of the MRP type and the item category.Until 3.0C, determination of the requirements type via planning strategy has taken priority.\\nThis is not always the best option, however, as the following example will show.\\nA requirements type is determined for a material, which causes availability to be checked against planning.\\nIn consignment stock processing, however, availability should be checked against stock.\\nUntil 3.0C the availability check had to be deactivated in these cases.\\nAs of Release 3.0C, you can determine how the requirements type is to be determined for each transaction by maintaining the Source field in Determination of requirement types using transaction in Customizing.• Requirements type\\n\\nControlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\nThe various requirements are identified by their requirements type.\\nThe requirements type refers to the requirements class and its control features.\\n• Requirements ClassThe requirements class contains all control features for planning such as relevance for planning, requirements planning strategy and requirements consumption strategy.\\nIn addition, it is specified at a global level whether an availability check is to take place for the material in the sales and distribution documents on the basis of the ATP quantity (ATP = available to promise) and whether requirements are to be passed on.\\nA finer degree of control can be obtained for sales documents using the schedule line category.\\n\\nControl Features Specific to Sales and Distribution\\nThe following SD-specific control features need to be maintained in Customizing:\\n• Checking groupThe checking group controls whether the system is to create indivdual or collective requirements in sales and shipping processing.\\nIn addition, a material block for the availability check with transfer of requirements can be set here.\\nThe checking group can also be used to deactivate the availability check.\\nThis option was created especially for the assembly order so that when the bill of material is exploded in the assembly order, the individual components, if necessary, can be classified as non-critical parts as far as procurement is concerned.The checking group specifies in combination with the checking rule the scope of the availability check.\\nIt is proposed in the material master record on the basis of the material type and the plant, and copied into the sales and distribution documents.• Checking RuleYou use the checking rule to control the scope of the availability check for each transaction in sales and distribution.\\nYou also specify whether the check should be carried out including or excluding replenishment lead time.\\nThe individual checking rules define by transaction, which stock and inward and outward movement of goods should be taken into account for the availability check.• Schedule line categoryYou can control with the schedule line category whether an availability check and transfer of requirements should be carried out in the sales documents.\\nThe possible settings for this at schedule line level are dependent on the settings in the requirements class which is determined from the requirements type of the material.• Delivery item categoryThe delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes place in deliveries.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\nAn availability check can only be carried out if the following prerequisites have been fulfilled:\\n',\n",

Planned independent requirements are created in demand management for a specified period of time for expected order quantities. After incoming orders have been processed, appropriate consumption quantities are transferred to material requirements planning for the order quantities of materials for which the requirements are consumed by demand management. For further information, see the R/3 PP documentation on demand program planning.\\n | Planning consumption and the allocation of the various consumption strategies are activated in Customizing and are dependent on the requirements class.\\n | Prerequisite for planning consumption is that the relevant sales and distribution applications perform transfer of requirements. If the availability check is also switched on, the check is carried out against the ATP (available to promise) quantity rather than the planning quantity. However, a consumption quantity is still forwarded in the requirements record.\\n | Allocating Independent Requirements in the Sales Document\\n | If planning allocation takes place for an item during sales processing, the planning allocation control screen appears if the independent requirements allocated to the material do not cover the order quantity. This screen is identical to the availability control screen.\\n | The planning allocation control screen does not appear if the availability check is switched on for the resulting schedule line category.\\n | Reducing Independent Requirements\\n | Independent requirements from planning are reduced by the goods issue posting in the delivery. The quantity decrease is determined from the consumption quantity which is transferred for the relevant item in the underlying order, as well as from the appropriate consumption period and mode.\\n | You enter the consumption mode and the consumption period in the MRP 3 screen in the material master record.\\n | Consumption Mode\\n | The consumption mode defines whether and in which direction on the time axis from the requirements date the consumption of customer requirements with planned independent requirements should occur. The requirements date corresponds to the date the sales order items were created.\\n | You have the following options:\\n | • No planning consumption\\n | • Backwards consumption only\\n | Starting from the requirements date, backwards consumption is carried out within the relevant consumption period.\\n | Allocating and Reducing Independent Requirements in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n | • Forwards consumption only\\n | Starting from the requirements date, forward consumption is carried out within the relevant consumption period.\\n | • Backwards/forwards consumption\\n | Starting from the requirements date, backwards consumption is performed first of all.

       "  'chunk_text': 'Product Allocation\\nA precise planning and controlling mechanism is of the utmost importance for the execution of competitive order processing with guaranteed efficient and timely delivery to the customer of the required order quantity.\\nUnforseen problems, such as production deficits or increased demand can have critical consequences for order processing and must be brought under control as soon as possible.Product allocation is a function provided by the R/3 system for carrying out these control options intended to help your company to avoid critical requirement and procurement situations.\\nThis should enable you to keep production to a minimum at the same time as allowing you to react quickly to bottlenecks and changing market situations.In the R/3 system, product allocations represent an ordered allocation of production for certain periods.\\nProduct allocations can be created according to various criteria (i.e., customer, regions).Product allocations are created in the logistics controlling area in the planning hierarchy (Logistics →=Logist. controlling →=Flexible planning →=Planning create/change →=Planning type: COMMIT for SAP standard planning type).\\nProduct allocations are always divided right up to the lowest level in the hierarchy.\\nThe basis for the planning hierarchy is info structure “S140”, which SAP issues as the standard info structure.\\nIt determines the criteria of the hierarchy.\\nYou can define your own info structures in Customizing for LIS (Logistics General →=Logistics Information System →=Reporting →=Standard Analyses →=Change settings).When creating product allocations, make sure that you use version number “000”.Because updates are carried out for this version number.If a product allocation of 5000 pieces were to be entered at the material level as depicted in the diagram below, it would be automatically distributed among the lower levels (= consistent planning).\\nChanges are possible at every level, but the other levels are still adjusted automatically.As of Release 3.0F, it is possible to carry out an availability check against product allocations.\\nThe check is still carried out if neither the availability check nor transfer of requirements areactivated in Customizing.\\nThis ensures, for example, that when production is low, the first customer does not get the full amount, resulting in following sales orders not being confirmed or being confirmed far too late.\\nThe check is carried out on the basis of the confirmed quantity from the ATP check against the corresponding product allocation.To get reliable information and to recognise critical situations, the actual requirements are compared with the planning product allocations throughout the entire product allocation period.\\n\\nGeneral Requirements\\nTo carry out availability check against product allocation, certain requirements must be met:\\n• Material master• In the material master, the product allocation determination procedure must be entered in the basic data screen for general data.• Statistics updateIn Customizing for the Logistics Information System, statistics updating must be set for the information structure.\\nThis is required at customer, material and header level.\\nThe update group must also be maintained in Customizing for the Logistics Information System.• In Customizing for SD, the settings must be made for availability check against product allocation.\\nYou will find the necessary steps described in the Implementation Guide in section “Availability check against product allocations”.\\nThis is where, the necessary Customizing activities for the statistics update are described.Availability Check Against Product Allocation During Order Entry SD',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Availability Check Against Product Allocation During Order Entry SD\\nThe planning hierarchies for product allocations are created in logistics controlling.\\nIf the correct settings have been made in Customiuing, the system carries out an availability check against the ATP quantity in SD during order entry.\\nIf the availability check determines that the ATP quantity can fully or partially cover the order requirement, then a confirmed quantity is determined as the result of the check.\\nThe confirmed quantity is the basis for the availability check against product allocation, which is carried out along with the ATP check.The confirmed quantity from the ATP check is checked against the relevant product allocation.\\nThis ensures that the product allocation for this period is not exceeded.\\nRequired quantities that cannot be confirmed, because the product allocation for that period is used up, are postponed until the next period.The result of the product allocation check can change confirmed quantities that have already been determined.\\nIn this case you receive a message before branching to the availability control screen.For example, even though the material for an order for 100 pieces may be available in full for the required date according to the ATP check, it is only partially confirmed because the product allocation for that customer only had a value of 80 pieces remaining at the time of order entry.\\nThe confirmed quantity for the required quantity and an alternative delivery date is displayed on the control screen.Unlike the ATP check, the check date for the availability check against product allocations is the planned delivery date for the customer and not the material availability date.The actual order quantities are updated in the planning hierarchy of the LIS.\\nComprehensive reporting tools and an early warning system in the LIS that has to be set in Customizing monitor the status of the product allocation period and report critical situations immediately.Product allocation uses a blocking mechanism similar to quantity block in the ATP check: The check hierarchy of the corresponding product allocation object is only blocked exclusively during the check itself.\\nAfterwards, the same object can also be used by other processes without the current procedure having been saved.\\nThe product allocation quantity used is, however, seen in all subsequent processes (via this blocking mechanism) to prevent over-confirmation.Display Availability Check Against Product Allocation',\n",

These tools are not dedicated to one unique application or module; they are used throughout the system to integrate and automate SAP processes. The following is a brief description and overview of a few of the major functional areas in SAP.\\n | Financial Applications\\n | This application component contains, among others, the following modules:\\n | • FI Financial Accounting\\n | • CO Controlling\\n | • EC Enterprise Controlling\\n | • IM Investment Management\\n | • PS Project System\\n | Human Resources Applications\\n | The Human Resources module includes support for salary and payroll administration, as well as areas such as work schedule models. This core functional area is country-specific, due to country-related taxes, employee benefits, and employment laws.\\n | This functional area contains, among others, the following modules:\\n | • PA Personnel Administration\\n | • PT Personnel time Management\\n | • PY Payroll\\n | Logistics Applications\\n | Logistics (referring to the supply chain) is the largest of the three functional areas. It includes, among others, the following modules:\\n | • SD Sales and Distribution\\n | • MM Materials Management\\n | • PP Production Planning and Control\\n | • LE Logistics Execution\\n | • QM Quality Management\\n | • CS Customer Service\\n | We will be focusing on the Sales and Distribution (SD) module of mySAP.

To view the transaction code from within the screen you are accessing, select System | Status.\\nIn this book the standard menu path is always described from the SAP Easy Access Screen (unless specifically stated from the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide).\\nThis “Easy Access Menu” is generally the first screen that users will face in the system.\\nBecause it is the first screen users will face, it may be highly configured using area menus to restrict the transactions the user will be using.\\nTo revert back to the original user menu from this screen, simply select the menu path Menu | SAP menu [transaction code S000].\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nFIGURE 1-4 Here the transaction code is [VA22], which is the Change Quotation transaction code.\\nAn example of using the menu path to get to the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide from the SAP Easy Access Screen is\\n\\nSAP menu |Tools |Customizing |IMG | SPRO - Execute Project\\nas seen in Figure 1-5.\\nThe [SPRO] transaction code is the shortcut for the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide.\\nPlease refer to Chapter 5 to read about creating your own transaction codes.\\nHere are a number of simple transaction codes you will get accustomed to using:\\n | Code | Description\\n | --- | ---\\n | VA01 | Create sales document\\n | VL01N | Create outbound delivery with reference\\n | VF01 | Create billing document\\n | SPRO | Enterprise SAP Customizing Implementation Guide\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 1-5\\nThe menu path from the Logistics screen to the Implementation Guide\\nCopyright by SAP AGA fantastic navigation tip is to use the central “Easy Access” menus, which provide a menu tailored to the function you are processing.\\nFor example, all transactions related to sales master data may be found by using [VS00].\\nRefer to the following list for transaction codes to further menus. | Code | Description\\n | --- | ---\\n | VS00 | Sales master data\\n | VC00 | Sales support\\n | VA00 | Sales\\n | VL00 | Shipping\\n | VT00 | Transportation\\n | VF00 | Billing\\n | VX00 | Foreign trade\\n',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Introduction to SD Customer Master Data\\nMaster data forms the basis of all transactional processing.\\nThis is especially true for Sales and Distribution processing.\\nMaster data creation, ownership, and maintenance are the responsibility of all modules.\\nThe structure and data within a company’s master data govern how the system is to respond to future transactions or analysis.\\n\\nCustomer Master Data\\nCustomer master data in SD is divided into three main areas.\\n• Basic Data This data remains the same for the customer regardless of which organization he buys from your company.\\nExamples of this type of data are the customer address and contact details.• Organizational Data This is customer data related to your organizational structure—for example, the customer may prefer stock to be delivered from plant YX01 when an order is placed in a specific sales area.\\n(Sales area is explained later.) The customer may then wish stock to be delivered from a plant closer to his location YX02 when a sales order is placed in another sales area.\\nA customer master record may exist for many sales areas.\\nYou can then have different data for the different sales areas, even though you are taking the order from the same customer and using the same customer number.• Company Code Data A customer master record must also have company-related data.\\nThis data is used for financial accounting purposes.\\nAn example of company code data is the reconciliation account.\\nA customer master record may exist for more than one company code—for example, when you have more than one company in your organization and the customer can buy from any one of them.A sales area is a specific combination of a sales organization, a distribution channel, and a division.\\nThe sales organization is the legal entity responsible for the sale.\\nYou usually have a sales organization for each company code.\\nThe distribution channel is the way you send your product to the market—for example, you may have a retail distribution channel and a wholesale distribution channel.\\nA division is a product division—for example, original equipment or spare parts.\\nThe combination of these represents the sales area.\\nSo when a customer places an order with sales organization ABC in the retail distribution channel for spare parts, you have identified the sales area.\\nThe processes may differ when a customer purchases from the same sales organization and the same division, but is purchasing wholesale, so the sales area would then be different as well.\\n(Due to the distribution channel being different, that is wholesale.) The customer master sales area data allows you to specify different master data (for example different payment terms) based on the sales areas.\\nThere are additional forms of customer master data—for example, the customer credit master record, which is related to the customer master record, shown in Figure 1-13.\\nHowever, these additional forms of master data are not mandatory and are covered in their own chapters in this book.\\nWe describe how to maintain the customizing, insert, and remove fields, as well as partner functions, of the customer master record later in this chapter.',\n",

Thus, 10 customer master records with 2 sales organizations, 2 distribution channels, and 2 divisions would have a total of 80 customer master record views. Add another sales organization and you have 120 customer master record views. Adding divisions does not multiply the material master views; however, it does multiply the customer master views. For example, add a division to our 80 customer master views and we suddenly have 120 customer master views. However, add the division to the material master views, and we still end up with 80. TIP To reduce the master data you require, you can combine sales areas for customer master data purposes—see the Implementation Guide (IMG | Sales and Distribution | Master Data | Define Common Distribution Channels (and Division)).\\n | We know a sales area is compiled of a sales organization, a distribution channel, and a division. A sales area is used for reporting purposes; all data relevant for sales can be defined per sales area. For example, you can define pricing per sales area, or do your sales information analyses per sales area. You can also control configuration based on the sales area—for example, you can allow some sales processes for one sales area (for example, product samples), but not for another.\\n | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide\\n | The Implementation Guide is used to collectively group the areas that must be customized, as well as to form a structure for documentation.\\n | Additional information may be added to the guide to make navigation more simple.

       "  'chunk_text': 'Defining a Shipping Point\\nA shipping point is assigned to one or more plants and can be divided into several loading points.\\nHowever, deliveries are created for shipping points.Generally, companies create deliveries using a background job, running the delivery due list.\\nThe shipping point is used as a criterion for delivery creation, so if you have express shipping and want the background job to run more frequently for these deliveries, it is advisable to have an express shipping point.\\nThis shipping point may be used for the scheduled background job and may be executed more frequently (for example, every 15 minutes) than the other shipping points.You can configure the shipping point to be defaulted automatically in the sales order or delivery based upon the plant (used in the sales document), loading group (of the material), and shipping condition (of the customer master).\\nFor example, for a plant in Southern California, if the loading group is air transport and the shipping condition is express, use the Express Air Transport Shipping Point.\\nThe person responsible for processing these deliveries will see the delivery in their delivery due list when the sales order is saved.If the plant is in Northern California and the shipping condition is express and the loading group is road transport, another shipping point will be proposed.\\nSo the delivery will appear in another delivery due list.Here is how you define your Shipping point. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Definition | Logistics Execution | Define, Copy, Delete, Check Shipping Point A shipping point is the top level of organization in shipping. Deliveries are always initiated from exactly one shipping point. A shipping point can be subdivided into several loading points. A loading point is a voluntary entry, merely a subdivision of a shipping point. It is manually entered into the header data of the delivery. For example, if a shipping point has five loading bays, you may create five loading points in SAP to represent each one. Now that the organizational units have been defined, we can assign the units into an organizational structure. Assignment of Organizational Units In assignment of the organizational data you link the different modules in the system by defining how the structures relate to one another. This is best shown by the association of sales organizations and plants. A plant is always linked to one company code, and can be linked to several sales organizations. This means that the plant is owned by the company code and can only take orders from and make deliveries to customers in its sales organization. This is illustrated in Figure 1-22. In Figure 1-22 Plants 1, 2, and 3 belong to Company code 1. Sales organization 1 uses Plants 1 and 2. Sales organization 2 uses Plants 2 and 3. Sales organizations 1 and 2 can make cross-company sales for goods from Plants 4 or 5. After you have defined your data, and the other application components have defined theirs (such as the company codes having been defined by FI and the plants by MM), it is time to assign the SD organizational data.The assignments are extremely easy settings to make once you understand how the structures should be built up (as explained previously).\\nThey are assigned in the following structure paths in the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide:• SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Assignment | Sales and Distribution:\\n• Assign sales organization to company code.\\n• Assign distribution channel to sales organization. | Company code 1 | Company code 2\\n | --- | ---\\n | Plant 1 | Plant 2 | Plant 3 | Plant 4 | Plant 5\\n | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\\n | Sales organization 1 | Sales organization 2 | Sales organization 3\\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | FIGURE 1-22 Plant association with sales organizations |  | \\n• Assign division to sales organization.\\n• Set up sales area.\\n• Assign sales office to sales area.\\n• Assign sales group to sales office.\\n• Assign sales organization, distribution channel, and plant.\\n• Assign sales area to credit control area.\\n(We will cover the credit control area assignment in detail in Chapter 10.)\\n• SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Assignment | Logistics Execution:\\n• Assign shipping point to plant.Shipping points are assigned to the plant here, but their determination is not defined here.\\nPlease refer to Chapter 6 for information about shipping point determination.\\nAfter the assignment you should have a business organizational structure similar to the following:',\n",

This data is only identified by the customer number, and is not specific to the company code or sales area. Maintaining the data is possible from both the company code view ([XD02]) and the sales and distribution view ([VD02]).\\n | • Company Code Data This data is mostly of interest to the accounting department. It includes, for example, information on the reconciliation account and dunning procedures and withholding tax. This data applies to only one company code. Transaction code [XD01] is used to create customer master data, with company code relevant data.\\n | • Sales and Distribution Data This data is only of interest for the sales and distribution area. It includes, for example, data on pricing or shipping. This data only applies to one sales area, and therefore is dependent on the sales structure (sales organization, distribution channel, division).\\n | When changing a customer master record from transaction code [VD02], you can click the button Customer/Sales Areas. This will give a list of combinations of sales organizations, distribution channels, and divisions for which the customer has already been created. You need not have different customer numbers if your customer was serviced by more than one company code.

Credit management is linked to the customer master but will be covered in Chapter 10. A short summary of customer master data relevance is:\\n | • Company Code Data applies to one company code.\\n | • Sales and Distribution Data applies to one sales area.\\n | • Basic Data remains the same regardless of the company code or sales area selected.\\n | Therefore if you edit the customer master record you must specify the customer number and company code, using transaction code [XD02], in order to access the screens containing company code data.\\n | Control over the customer master records is vitally important to ensure consistency in reporting and usage of the system. If you do not intend to use all the address fields of the customer basic data view, it is advisable to suppress the fields. Often, companies leave all the fields open and maintainable, resulting in non-uniformity of address field usage. This leads to messy layouts for output and inconsistent reporting.\\n | Material Master Data\\n | The material master data is used by the system to represent the product or service your company is selling or producing. It is compiled in much the same way as the customer master record using multiple views to represent the same material within the different areas of the business. For example, the plant view contains all the plant-specific material and can be different for each plant in the organization.\\n | To create material master data records, use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Master Data | Products | Material | Other Material | Create (or by using the transaction code [MM01]) You are presented with the following screen as shown in Figure 2-5. You will notice that one mandatory field is the material type. Material type is similar to the customer account group in the way that it governs what fields are relevant for data input. It also controls how the material behaves. A few common material types are • HAWA- Trading good • NLAG- Non-stock material • FERT- Finished product • VERP- Packaging material • DIEN- Service It is possible to create your own versions of these material types; however, this is done in the Materials Management module.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 2-5 Creating material master data.\\n | The Material Type field is mandatory on the [MM01] screen as this screen is used to create all types of materials. Should you follow the standard menu path and create, for example, a “trading good,” the system does not need a material type entered as it is defaulted by the system based on the menu selection. As you can see, you have the option to create with reference to an existing material. This is a popular way to quickly create a new material from one that exists already and is very similar.\\n | There are a number of views you may select from. As with the customer master record, you have sales views as well as accounting views. A few relevant material master views are as follows:\\n | • Accounting 1, 2 Valuation and costing information. Examples of fields would be standard price, past and future price, and moving average cost price.\\n | • Material Requirements Planning (MRP) 1, 2, 3, 4 Information for material requirements planning (MRP) and consumption-based planning/inventory control/ availability check. Examples of fields include safety stock level, planned delivery time, and reorder level for a material. A crucial field value for MM, PP, and SD is the MRP type, which will be covered with the schedule line categories in Chapter 3.\\n | • Purchasing Data provided by Purchasing for a material. Examples of fields include purchasing group responsible for a material, over- and under-delivery tolerances, and the order unit.\\n | • General Plant Data Storage 1, 2 Information relating to the storage/warehousing of a material.

Examples of fields include delivering plant, taxes, pricing reference material, and item category group. The availability check indicator, which controls how the system determines if stock is available for a sales order and when it will be available, is included here as well. These subjects are covered in detail in Chapter 3.\\n | The pricing reference material is a field where you can enter a material for which you have a material master record and prices in your system and that you wish to use as a reference for the material you are busy creating or editing. This means you can create the pricing master data for one material, and then let many materials in the material master reference that pricing. This is much better than maintaining the same pricing master data multiple times for many materials.\\n | The item category group is of utmost importance to SD. It covers how the material behaves from the sales quotation right through to the invoice. In fact, all sales documents are dependent on the value in this field. We will cover item category determination in Chapter 3.\\n | Material Master Units of Measure\\n | A material can be stored, transported, and sold in various units of measure. In mySAP ERP, you can define various units of measure that are maintained in the sales and distribution screens of the material master record.\\n | However, you only need to maintain the fields of the units of measure if they deviate from the base unit of measure. You can enter the following units of measure in the Sales and Distribution screens:\\n | • Base Unit of Measure This is the unit of measure used as a basis for all transactions. All quantity movements in other units of measure, should any exist, are converted automatically by the system into the base unit of measure. For instance, the base unit of measure may be pieces—as an example, stock of widgets is managed in pieces.\\n | • Alternative Unit of Measure If a product is managed in the base unit of measure “piece” but is sold in the sales unit “box,” you must define the conversion factor. The alternative unit of measure can define, for example, that one box of this material contains five pieces.\\n | • Sales Unit The unit of measure in which materials are sold is referred to as a sales unit (for example, piece, box, or bottle). The value you define in the material master record is proposed during business transactions relevant for sales. You can replace them with other alternative units of measure in the sales order. For example, if you sell widgets in boxes, then you would use the box unit of measure as the sales unit.\\n | • Delivery Unit The delivery unit refers to the unit in which materials can be delivered. Only exact multiples of the delivery unit can be delivered. For example, with a delivery unit of 30 bottles, 30, 60, or 90 bottles can be delivered, but not 100 bottles.\\n | Quantity Specifications\\n | SAP uses two different quantity specifications for the material master record:\\n | • Minimum Order Quantity The minimum order quantity refers to the minimum quantity the customer must order. A warning message appears if the minimum order quantity is not reached during order entry.\\n | • Minimum Delivery Quantity The minimum delivery quantity refers to the minimum quantity you must deliver to the customer. The minimum delivery quantity is automatically checked during delivery processing. A warning message appears during delivery processing if you enter a delivery quantity lower than the minimum delivery quantity.\\n | As unusual as it may seem, should you wish to restrict the quantity a customer may order, you should use a quantity contract as explained in Chapter 4.\\n | Customer-Material Info Records\\n | Customer-material information is information on a material that applies to a specific customer when they buy a specific material. For example, the customer may have its own des',\n",

You can record this customer-specific information for a material in a customer-material info record.\\n | The data in the customer-material info record has priority when master data is copied into an SAP transaction. When you create a sales order, for example, the default material data will be copied from the customer-material info record. If that does not exist, SAP will use the material data for the sales area.\\n | You can create customer-material info records by using the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Master Data | Agreements |\\n | Customer Material Information | [VD51] – Create\\n | It may also be accessed from the relevant customer master record. From within the customer master record (that is, inside [VD02]), select Environment | Customer Material Information.\\n | This data is dependent on the sales area, so data created for sales organization 1000 will be different than data created for sales organization 2000. Figure 2-6 shows the screen you are faced with when creating a customer material information record.\\n | Enter the material that you store in your plant or sell. Enter the customer’s product name or description. Select the entry and select details. You now have the information relevant to the sale and shipment of this particular material, as shown in Figure 2-7. Of special importance is the plant for determination in the sales order. The main attribute of the customer-material info record is the Customer Material, where the customer could give his description of his material CONNECTOR_001 and we would automatically determine our product of BVL10. The system defaults the plant data in the sales order from the relevant entries in the master records based upon the following priority:\\n | 1. Customer-material info master record\\n | 2. Customer master record\\n | 3. Material master record\\n | The default entries will apply to the order item unless manually overwritten in the sales document.\\n | Another important entry is the Delivery Priority. This field is used as a selection parameter when creating the delivery—for example, in the Delivery Due List (which is covered in Chapter 6). It is also used for rescheduling. As the rescheduling process in SAP is a complex one, it is advised you do not alter the process or use this field for any purpose other than what it was created for.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 2-6 Creating a customer-material info record.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 2-7 Item details of the customer-material info record.\\n | Make sure the relevant indicator is set on the sales document type so that the system will read the customer-material info record. See Chapter 3, “Sales Document Types.”\\n | Master Data Specifics\\n | In this section we will cover elements that affect master data as well as introduce master data in tables.\\n | Master Data Sharing, Common Distribution Channels, and Common Divisions\\n | You are able to define common distribution channels and divisions. This is possible for two master data areas of mySAP ERP: For all master-relevant data and for all condition-relevant data. This negates the requirement for having multiple copies of master data, with the only differing parameter being the distribution channel or division.\\n | You would use this option when you do not want to differentiate the master data based on the sales organization. For example, if you define many sales divisions for reporting purposes, you will have to create customer master sales screens for every combination of sales organization, distribution channel, and division. But if you make the division common, then you only have to maintain the customer master sales screens for the various sales organizations, distribution channels, and the common division.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 2-8 SAP Customizing Implementation Guide menu path for common distribution channels.

       "  'chunk_text': ' in Figure 2-8. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Master Data | Define Common Distribution Channels [VOR1] You can group the distribution channel and division separately for either the master data (which combines customer master and material master records), or group the distribution channel and division separately for condition records, or both the master data and condition records.\\n | For example: You have a product range that is not different for the four different distribution channels you have. (The four distribution channels could be telesales, retail, industry, and wholesale.) Neither is there a difference in the customers details when they purchase through one channel or the other. Thus, you do not wish to create four views of customer master and material master records, based upon the four sales areas. Select one distribution channel and division to use as the master or common one—for example, retail. Create the customer master records and material master records in the common distribution channel (retail). Then assign the other distribution channels you created in the organizational structure setup to this one. Whenever SAP sees a distribution channel linked to the common distribution channel, it will use the master data for the common distribution channel.\\n | Don’t forget, this means you can only create or change master data in the distribution channel that is being referenced. In the previous scenario that would mean you can only change data for the retail distribution channel. Even if you should access a customer or material master in change mode and press F4 (matchcode search help for possible entries) and select telesales, industry, or wholesale, you will receive a message stating “Sales area is not defined……” The same is true for the sharing of conditions. If conditions are shared, you need only create a condition in the distribution channel or division you are using as the reference. Obviously, this only pertains to conditions that are specific to the distribution channel and or division (that is, these fields are in the condition key).\\n | Customer Groups\\n | The customer group is a grouping of customers that is configured under master data in the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide. After defining the group and allocating it a two- digit alphanumeric key, you may assign the group to the customer master record.\\n | The customer group is a wonderful field that is copied into the header and item level of the sales document. This is very useful for reporting and pricing purposes.\\n | You can define the customer group using the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Master\\n | Data | Business Partners | Customers | Sales | Define Customer Groups [OVS9]\\n | Simply assign a two-digit alphanumeric key to the text description you would best use to define your customer grouping. Now proceed to the customer master record [VD02] sales screen and enter the appropriate customer group. Should you want this field to be a mandatory field, so that no customer master record may be created without this entry, you may define it as mandatory using the account group as we saw earlier in this chapter. The customer group is a field that can be used to generate statistics as well as to create condition records such as pricing—for example, should you wish to offer discounts per wholesale customer group, but not per retail customer group. It is especially useful as it is on the sales tab of the customer master record and therefore it is on the customer related table of the customer master record that is table KNVV.\\n | Sales Districts, Sales Offices, and Sales Groups\\n | Sales districts, sales offices, and sales groups can refer to differing geographical areas or regions, or merely used as a grouping term on the customer master record. In their truest use, a sales district refers to a region where the customer is located. The sales office refers to a sub-grou',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Master Data Configuration > Partner Determination > Functions | Partner Determination | Set Up Partner Determination\\nBy referring back to master data, covered earlier in this chapter, we see that each partner (customer) master record is created on the basis of a specific account group—for example, Sold-to parties use account group 0001.We also note the four basic partner functions: | SP | Sold-to Party | (German -AG)\\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | SH | Ship-to Party | (German -WE)\\n | BP | Bill-to Party | (German -RE)\\n | PY | Payer | (German -RG)\\nEach partner function may be assigned a partner type, which specifies whether this partner is a customer (for example, partner type KU), contact person, vendor, etc.The overview screen is dependent on the option selected in the IMG.\\nWe will look at maintaining the partner determination for the customer master record.\\nWe see a list of all partner determination procedures, as seen in Figure 2-14.Let’s look at the configuration of the partner determination procedure AG.By selecting the partner function AG and the partner functions in procedure, as seen in Figure 2-15, we will have the result seen in Figure 2-16.The first checkbox is to make the partner “Not Modifiable,” that is, once it is in the customer master record it cannot be changed.\\nGenerally, this is only used for the Sold-to Party.The second checkbox is to make the partner function mandatory, that is, the partner must be determined or manually entered in the customer master record.FIGURE 2-14 Partner determination procedures\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nFIGURE 2-15 Partner determination procedure navigation\\nCopyright by SAP AGFIGURE 2-16 Partner functions in procedure Remember each account group we created.\\nThose account groups would not function without a partner determination procedure being assigned to them.\\nIn Figure 2-17, we see the partner procedure AG assigned to the account group 0001.\\nBelow partner determination procedure assignment, partner functions are defined.\\nFor example, the partner determination procedure AG has the mandatory partner function AG.\\nLet us look at the “definition” of the partner function AG in Figure 2-18.\\nThe definition of the partner function AG is shown as the highlighted value SP, which will be explained a little later.In Figure 2-18 you can see the Sold-to Party is partner type KU – customer.\\nWhile the in-completion procedure assigned to the SP partner function is 07, this in- completion procedure is used by the system to register partner fields that are not filled at the time of creating the sales order.\\nThe in-completion procedure then prompts the user to complete these fields with missing values.\\nWe will cover the “higher-level function” as well as the “customer hierarchy type” in Chapter 9 in “Customer Hierarchies.”The “unique in customer master” indicator is set for the Sold-to Party.\\nThis indicates that the system must only allow one entry of this partner function in the customer master record.\\nAs opposed to multiple entries of a partner function being permitted, for example Ship-to Party.Copyright by SAP AGFIGURE 2-17 Partner determination procedure assignment The next step is to assign the valid account groups to the partner functions as seen in Figure 2-19.\\nOnly account groups in this list can play this role.\\nFor example, the Sold-to Party can be a sold-to party (account group 0001) or a prospective customer (account group 005), etc.Should you create a new customer account group—for example, a copy of 0001—do not forget to assign the new account group to the list of allowed account groups for partner determination.Finally, it may seem confusing that the partner function AG is referred to as SP.\\nThe reason for this is that the German definition for the partner function was initially AG for “Auftraggeber.”\\nYou are now able to change the partner function’s value according to the language the translation is created for and the language with which the user logs onto the system, as seen in Figure 2-20.FIGURE 2-18 Partner function AG is deﬁned as SP.',\n",

To create a new number range, first find the exact requirements of the business.\\nThey may want the number range to be shared by numerous document types, so it will have to have a large interval because it will number many transactions.\\nYou need to consider how many transactions will be processed so you can define a large enough number range.\\nFind an interval that is not yet used and select the Interval button.\\nNext, enter your alphanumeric key (for example, Y1) followed by the From and To numbers for the range.\\nThen indicate if the number range is internal or external.\\nFor most document types you may only want to use an internal number assignment.\\nShould you be doing any data conversion of old documents—for example, sales documents into new mySAP ECC6 documents—ensure your number range matches the permitted range of the country/legal entity.\\nFor example, in Brazil the number ranges are unique and one is not permitted to have gaps in sequence.Interval buttonCopyright by SAP AGFIGURE 3-2 Number range intervalsNumber ranges are manually transported through clients.\\nA client is the environment you are working in.\\nGenerally, companies have a system with a client for each environment—for example, a development environment or the quality or production environment.\\nWhen transporting the number range interval, the intervals you have in the client you are exporting into will be deleted first, then the number range and assigned status will be created in the new client.\\nAlso note that the number range assignments to document types or other objects are not transported with this manual transport.\\nI recommend that you create the number ranges individually in each client rather than transport them.\\nThis is because if you transport the number ranges, you could cause a problem with duplicate entries in the database.\\nIf this situation happens, the SAP program will abort and the data will not be saved.For example: In client 001 you have a number range from 0000001 to 9999999.\\nThe current number is 000084.\\nIn client 002, you have the same number range, but the current number is 0003429.\\nThese represent records in the database.\\nNow you transport from 001 to 002.\\nYour new starting number is 0000084 in client 002.\\nWhen you try and save the record, the system assigns 0000085 to the document.\\nBut document 0000085 already exists in the database.\\nThe transaction terminates with an error and the data is not saved.\\nIn this case you need to check the last number in the table using transaction code [SE16] or [SE16n] and then change the number range status to reflect the last number used.\\nThen the next number assigned will be unique.',\n",

Customers who place quotations may place a fixed order 80 percent of the time. This means that the quote document probability is 80 percent. You can look at all the quotes in the system and be reasonably sure that you will have to deliver 80 percent of the quantity. So you can plan your MRP based on this value. • Output application is used in output determination, which we’ll cover in Chapter 9. Output determination sets what outputs, such as printouts and e-mail messages, are created. • Screen sequence, display range, and function code for overview screens are all values that can be manipulated. They control how the interface is represented in the sales document—that is, should you wish the system to propose a different screen for quotations than for orders, you can change these entries. Generally, you need a skilled ABAP resource to create specialist screen overviews. The function code for overview screen determines which overview (or item list) screen users will see when they create a sales document of this type. For example, if a customer material is always used, you could default the overview screen to a screen that includes this field. • The incompletion procedure identifies which fields are considered incomplete if the values are null. This is covered in Chapter 4. • Transaction group controls the data to be updated in the respective tables for each transaction of the respective document type. • Document pricing procedure is an indicator that determines what pricing procedure the system will use in this sales order. For the purpose of product proposals, it is indicating “C.” Which is used in pricing procedure determination, please refer to pricing procedures in Chapter 8 for further data.Once you are satisfied with the settings, select the Copy button, as shown here, then enter a key with the customer name range permitted by SAP starting with a Y or a Z, followed by a description.Copyright by SAP AGNow that the document type is created, we need to ensure the correct number range is assigned.Proceed to the next level in the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide: “Define Number Ranges for Item Proposals.”\\nRefer to the “Number Ranges” section earlier in this chapter.\\nTo use the item proposal:1. Go to transaction code [VA51] and create the proposal.2. Go to transaction code [VA01] and create your sales order, then select Edit | Propose Items.You can select Propose Default, With Quantity, Without Quantity and Offer a Selection List.\\n\\nSales Document Types\\nSales document types control how the sales document must function.\\nFor example, a returns order to receive goods back from a customer will function differently than a sales order or a quotation.\\nThe sales document is comprised of three general levels of data and control:• The sales document header, which is controlled by the sales document type• The sales document item, which is controlled by the sales item category• The sales document schedule line, which is controlled by the schedule line categoryThe sales document type controls the central header details of the sales order—for example, the pricing procedure to be assigned to the sales document, or what type of document the sales document is.\\nFor now, we will focus on the configuration of the standard basic sales order process for the document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\\n\\nSales Documents | Sales Document Header | Define Sales Document Types [VOV8]\\nWhen dealing with the configuration of sales document types, generally one of two functions are performed.\\nOne either creates a new document type or alters an existing document type.\\nIt is recommended you follow these few basic guidelines:\\n• When creating a new document type, one should always reference the document type that is the closest match to the one you are aiming to create.\\nFor example, should you need a new sales order document type, you should copy document type TA (OR in English).\\nOnce you have copied the document type, the system copies all assigned data such as item category, schedule line category determination, and copying rules.\\nYou can then make the changes from this copy.',\n",

This will be covered in Chapter 4.\\n | • The correction delivery type is used for scheduling agreements.\\n | • The usage field is used to indicate on the sales order what the customer uses the material for. This entry will be copied into all items, or it may be placed into items individually in the sales order.\\n | • MRP for delivery schedule type is used for scheduling agreements in order for them to set if the system should use just in time (JIT) processing or forward the demands on to material requirements planning (MRP).\\n | • Delivery blocks can be automatically set for scheduling agreements. A blank entry indicates no delivery block.\\n | By referring to the shipping section seen in Figure 3-7 we can see the following data:\\n | • This is the standard shipping screen. It indicates that this document type is relevant for delivery, and the delivery type to be used for automatic processing is LF.\\n | • There is no automatic delivery block entered in the sales order.\\n | The shipping conditions are proposed by the customer master record. Should an entry have existed in this field, this entry would have taken precedence and overwritten those found on the customer master record. The shipping condition value is used to determine the shipping point. See Chapter 6 for information on shipping point determination.\\n | • The immediate delivery indicator is not set. This flag creates a delivery immediately after saving the sales order. So for each sales order you create, the delivery is created automatically by the system. The delivery is not completed and the picking, packing (if relevant), and goods issue must still be carried out.\\n | By referring to the billing section of the sales document type as seen in Figure 3-7, we can see the following data:\\n | • This document is relevant for invoicing and for delivery-related invoicing, the system automatically uses invoice document type F2.\\n | • When an order-related invoice is possible the system will use document type F2 for automatic processing as well. (This makes sense if you wish your order and delivery relevant products to be invoiced at the same time.) The inter-company billing document type for automatic processing is IV.\\n | • There is no automatic posting of a billing block on the sales order. It may be necessary, however, to have a billing block for credit notes, which we will look at later in this chapter.\\n | This means that the order cannot be billed until the billing block is removed. Using a billing block is a safety feature. For example, you may have a background job that creates invoices. When you save the order, this background job will see the order and then invoice it if it is for order-related billing. Using the billing block will prevent this from happening until the order has been checked and the billing block explicitly removed. The condition type for line items is used to determine the costing of the line item; it must be equal to the condition type allocated on your pricing procedure.\\n | • The billing plan type is either periodic billing, where the entire value to be billed to date is billed in full on the billing plan date (for example, a rental agreement), or milestone billing, where the total value to be billed is distributed between the individual billing plan dates (for example, for a project based on project milestones, where the value billed on each date can be a fixed amount or a percentage).\\n | • Payment guarantee procedure indicates to the system what form of guarantee procedure to use for this sales document. These are risk management.

For example, if you wish your contract to create a quotation for a new contract one week before the contract end date, you would specify what type of quotation document type (e.g., AG) that would be.\\n | • The check partner authority field is used by the system to check the partner type creating a release order against the contract. Only those partners with the partner function AG (Sold-to Party) or AA (Sold-to Party for release orders) as well as higher-level partners in a hierarchy are allowed to create release orders.\\n | • The update lower-level contracts field is used by the system to update lower-level contracts, should the data you are changing be the master contract. These changes are then passed down to the lower-level contracts via workflow. Should this field not be checked, the system will only update the lower-level contract when it is re-processed.\\n | • The business transaction for ATP field is used by the system to signal that communication must take place with the APO system to determine the ATP of this sales document type.\\n | NOTE ATP means “available to promise” and refers to when the business will be able to supply the goods being ordered—that is, when will procurement and production have the goods ready for shipping to the customer, preferably by the customer’s requested delivery date.\\n | NOTE APO is the Advanced Planner and Optimizer, an additional software component offered by SAP to allow a business to plan procurement and production.\\n | Assignment of Sales Areas to Sales Documents\\n | If the sales document types you created are permitted to be used by all sales areas, there is no need to create settings here.

It controls the sales document flow and also impacts the schedule line category. The item category of the sales order affects the delivery and finally impacts the billing process as well. Keeping to our basic sales flow, we will look at the integration of the item category into the following document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\\n | Defining Item Categories\\n | Unlike the sales document type, which is entered manually into the sales order at order creation, the item category is automatically determined by the system.

For standard processing this too can be left blank. However, should you wish to utilize these rules you must ensure you have set the update document flow indicator in copy control (see “Copy Control,” later in this chapter).You may use the completion rule if you use call-off orders for contracts for example. If the contract is for 1000 units, each time you create an order, the open quantity is adjusted for the new order. So if you create an order for 150 units, the open quantity on the contract becomes 850. The contract is complete either with the first order reference, but usually when the full quantity has been referenced.\\n | • The special stock indicator should be set for items that are processed as special stock.

Items that don’t have a delivery will use order-related billing. • The billing plan type defines if the item does milestone or periodic billing. (See Chapter 7 for more information on billing.)\\n | • The billing block indicator is used to block each item of this category for billing.\\n | • The pricing indicator is used by the system to propose if this item category is relevant for pricing. It would not make sense to indicate a text item for pricing.\\n | • Use the statistical value flag if you want the system to calculate the total values of all items at header level, or on the other hand not to include the value of the item.\\n | • The revenue recognition input field specifies the revenue recognition category for this item—for example, revenue is recognized at the same time as the invoice was created.\\n | • Delimit start date is used to determine the start date of the period in which revenues are to be recognized.\\n | • Business item is used to flag if the system should allow the item business data to be different from the business data at the header level. (Business data is a group of sales details, shipping details, and billing details. It is found at both item and header level and stored in table VBKD.) Schedule line allowed is used to determine if this sales item category is allowed a schedule line. This is one of the most important item settings as it determines if the item is relevant for schedule lines and therefore delivering or not. Refer to schedule line categories later on in this chapter.\\n | • Item relevant for delivery indicates to the system to copy the item from the sales order into the delivery note. This, however, should not be set for standard items, as a standard item would have a schedule line and thus be able to be determined as delivery-relevant. This flag should be used to indicate to the system to copy such items as text items into a delivery.\\n | • Should the item be a returns item category—for example, REN—then the returns flag should be set.\\n | • Weight/volume relevant is an indicator that tells the system if weight and volume are relevant and if the system should calculate these fields for these characteristics.\\n | • Credit active indicates that this item is relevant for credit control updating and credit statistics.

       "  'chunk_text': 'Sales Documents > Schedule Line Categories\\nFIGURE 3-17 Schedule line category behavior control The schedule line category controls the materials requirements planning and the execution in shipping. The schedule line category is determined based upon the item category and the MRP (materials requirements planning) type on the material master record of the item. It is possible for items with a schedule line to not be relevant for a delivery. Figure 3-17 depicts a basic overview of the standard functions of a few schedule line categories. Defining Schedule Line Category Keeping to our basic sales flow, we will look at the integration of the schedule line category into the following document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing). Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Sales Documents | Schedule Lines | Define Schedule Line Categories [VOV6] Represented in the IMG (IMG-Implementation Guide) are only two assignments: First, to create or define the schedule line category, as seen in Figure 3-18, and second, to assign it. We will first look at the schedule line category control and its characteristics. This schedule line category is the standard CP, which is relevant for MRP. It has an alphanumeric two-digit key as well as a short description. As seen in Figure 3-18, the business data section of the schedule line category defines the following:\\n• Whether a delivery block is automatically created for this schedule line category, (remember a delivery block can be set as automatic for any of the following):\\n• Sales document type\\n• Schedule line category\\n• Delivery type\\n• Shipping activity, such as picking and goods issue\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nFIGURE 3-18 Deﬁne schedule line category • For every movement of stock in the SAP system there is a movement type, which represents the inventory movement. For example, a movement of stock between plants has a movement type which is different from the movement of stock for a customer sale, which in turn is different from the movement type for receipt of stock for a customer return. This field indicates which SAP inventory movement to use for schedule line category CP. CP is assigned to item category TAN, which is a standard item category representative of a material to be sold to a customer. The goods movement is a movement from our stock as a sale to our customer. It would be correct to leave this field blank for items for which no stock movement happens. Likewise, should this schedule line be assigned to a return item category, you should ensure the movement type here is relevant for returns, such as a goods receipt. • The movement type 1-step is used when two goods movements need to happen for a schedule line category—for example, in a stock transfer (the issue of stock from one plant and another movement for the receipt of the stock into another plant). • The order type is the assignment of the purchase requisition type to the schedule line, which allows the system to automatically create a purchase requisition for this schedule line category. This is used for third-party sales—for example, if the customer places the order with you, but you need to buy the material from your supplier for delivery to the customer. The system can automatically create the purchase requisition to purchase the material from the supplier.\\nItem category is not to be confused with the sales document item category.\\nThis is the item category of the purchasing document or purchase requisition.• The account assignment category is used to determine which account assignment is necessary for the item.• The item relevant for delivery indicator must be set to indicate to the system that this schedule line category is delivery-relevant.• The purchase requisition delivery scheduling is an indicator you must set, should you want the system to re-determine the delivery dates of the schedule line based on the expected receipt times generated from the purchase requisition.The transaction flow data of the schedule line is depicted as follows:• The incompletion procedure is used to assign the fields that render a schedule line incomplete; it is covered more in Chapter 4.• The requirements/assembly indicator is used to transfer the requirements for the material to production (for materials produced in house, or to procurement for material purchased from a supplier).\\nThis demand will be shown in the stock requirements list, which we will cover in Chapter 5.• The availability check indicator is used by the system to determine if this item is relevant for availability checking.\\nThis will be covered more in Chapter 5.',\n",

For example, when you buy a car, the car is the basic product. You can choose the color, whether there is a sunroof, a tow bar, etc. These are the configuration options.) • The reexplode structure/free goods checkbox is used when you wish the system to redetermine the bill of materials in the sales document.\\nThe system does not copy the actual BOM from one sales document into another but copies the main material and then reexplodes the BOM into its components.\\nThe table entries for copying item category TAE to TAE are no longer required and are ignored if they exist.• The positive/negative qty option is used for document flow if you have specified the completion indicator on the item category.\\nYou can leave this field blank when copying from a sales order to another sales order.\\nBut for copying from a quote or a contract to a sales order, you may want to reduce the open quantity on the quote or contract when an order is created.• Copy quantity is best left blank.\\nThis forces the system to copy the quantity of the field best suited for the document type being referenced.\\nYou can force the target or order quantity to be used.• The pricing type is an extremely important field.\\nIt is worthwhile keeping this entry in mind when creating your pricing condition types.\\nAs a rule of thumb, you should have all item categories for a particular sales document with the same settings.\\nGenerally, you may use pricing type B (carry out new pricing), G (copy pricing elements unchanged and redetermine taxes), or C (copy manual pricing elements and redetermine the others).When using condition B all manual pricing condition types are lost.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Special Sales Document Types\\nThere are many sales document types and SAP allows you to create many more.\\nHowever, the sales document types we will focus on are the standard process most commonly used in SAP Sales and Distribution.\\nThese documents encompass their own business process procedures.\\nThe document flows we will look at are the following: the quotation; special sales orders such as the cash sale process and rush order process; the credit and debit cycle; as well as the returns and invoice correction request process, which is a combination of the credit and debit document.\\nWe will also look at contracts and scheduling agreements.\\n\\nSales Documents | Sales Document Header | Define Sales Document Types [VOV8]\\nIn the following document types, instead of repeating each field, I have simply listed the settings that should be allocated to that document and the reason why they should be chosen.\\n\\n\\nThe Quotation\\n(Sales document type AG (QT in English)) The quotation is a sales document type that comes before the sales order and after an inquiry.\\nIt is used as a proposed agreement of a price and quantity for a particular material or service for a particular date.\\nMost quotations have a validity date.\\nThe quotation can have pricing and schedule lines.\\nIt can have output assigned and credit checks assigned.\\nThe quotation is useful in business processes to determine if the material will be available at the right time for the customer at the right price.\\nShould the quotation be satisfactory it may be copied into a sales order.\\nDepending on the customizing entries, you can copy the pricing elements and the header data, as well as the item, material, and order quantities into the sales order.Ensure your quotation has sales document category B for quotations.\\nI recommend you set all document types relevant to read the customer material information record so set the indicator to “read info record.”\\nThe screen sequence group can be set at AG, which is SAP standard for quotations.\\nThe transaction group should be set as 2.\\nIt is also recommended you set a value for the quotation messages option.\\nThis will read the item level or header level to indicate to the user when he is creating a new quotation that an open quotation already exists for the customer if set at header level, or an open quotation already exists for the customer and material if set at item level.\\nDo not forget to set the item category determination and schedule line category determination as well as the copy control rules—for example, from a quotation to a sales order.The standard item category used in quotations is AGN. Order Probability When a sales inquiry or quotation is created you may want to know what the probability is that the customer will follow through with a purchase. The system uses an order probability percentage from the customer master record and combines it with the order probability percentage of the sales document type. The combination of the two percentages results in an order probability percentage and refers to the likelihood that the quote will become an order.\\n\\nThe Cash Sale Process\\n(Sales document type BV) You will use the cash sale process when the customer places the sales order and picks up and pays for the goods at the same time—for example, when you walk into a store and purchase goods.\\nThe system automatically proposes the current date in the sales order as the date for the delivery and billing.\\nOnce the sales order is saved, the system then creates a delivery automatically and prints out a cash sale invoice, which may be given to the Sold-to Party.\\nThis cash sale invoice is a paper form created via output determination (see Chapter 9).\\nThe delivery can be relevant for picking.\\n(See Chapter 6 for more information on the delivery and picking process.) Or if the goods are not to be picked (if, for example, the sold to party already has them), then the delivery can be marked not relevant for picking and the goods issue can happen automatically in the background so that the invoice can be created.\\nNote the billing can occur in the standard process.\\nAlso there is no accounts receivable postings from the billing document as the customer has already settled the invoice.\\nInstead the invoice amount is posted directly to a cash account.\\n',\n",

By using the same pricing values you ensure a complete reversal of the invoice.Do not forget to activate the update document flow checkbox on the copy control rules, between billing (invoice) and sales document (return).It is advisable to have a billing block assigned to the return order in the sales document header configuration to initiate a billing block automatically, in order to prevent a credit for returns being created until an authorized person releases the billing block.Once the returns delivery is created and goods receipted, the material is receipted back into the plant.\\nThe material should use a goods movement that receives the stock into blocked stock.\\nOnce the blocked stock has been inspected, you can either scrap it or rework it if the stock is faulty; or, if the stock is saleable, you can put it into unrestricted use stock.\\nThe stock is then available for the next sales order.It is advisable to indicate a shipping condition that is specifically used for returns; thus, all return deliveries or goods receipts may be done by a specific shipping point.\\n(See shipping point determination in Chapter 6.) This is useful when running the delivery due list.\\nYou can select only to process the returns deliveries, as well as offer better visibility of stock movements.The standard item category used by returns is REN.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Contracts and Special Processes\\nThis chapter focuses on sales contracts and special processes, with specific tips on their use and configuration in mySAP ERP.\\nNumerous business relationships relate to contracts or agreements with customers and the represented business, based upon material, price, and quantity over a fixed period of time.\\nContracts facilitate planning on behalf of the business and guarantee a fixed price agreement with the customer.\\nIn SAP the term “contracts” is represented as quantity contracts, value contracts, service contracts, and group master contracts.\\nIt is advisable to use a different number range for contracts (see “Number Ranges” in Chapters 3 and 10) as this ensures an easier time searching for documents and referencing contracts later.\\nThe area in the IMG for configuration of the contracts process is the same as the standard sales document types unless specifically stated.\\nThus, to configure the contract document type, use the following menu path.\\n\\nQuantity Contracts\\nThe quantity contract is a contract that happens after the quotation but before an order.\\nQuantity contracts are used mainly to limit the quantity the customer can buy and to offer special pricing.\\nGenerally, quantity contracts are used when the demand for a material is greater than the available supply, and the business has to implement measures to limit the supplied quantity evenly between its customer base.\\nThe SAP standard sales document type for quantity contracts is KM or CQ (English).The quantity contract does not transfer requirements.\\nThis means that:• It does not create a requirement for stock within the plant and subsequently there is no confirmation of stock within the plant for the contract.• It does not require production to make the stock to satisfy the contract.• It does not require material management to purchase the stock to satisfy the contract (if it is a trading good).The requirement is placed on the plant when the release order is created with reference to the quantity contract.\\nThe contract itself has no schedule lines.\\nIt does have a validity date.\\nThe contract allows the customer to have a special price per material for a limited quantity.\\nThis quantity decreases each time an order is made by the stock ordered.\\nOnce the contract validity date expires or the customer has purchased the full quota of stock, the contract expires, and a new one must be created.\\nQuantity contracts have no schedule lines or specific delivery dates, as they are not delivered.\\nAn order from a contract is called a release order; the delivery is done from the release order.For example, a contract is made with a quantity of 1,000 items.\\nThen each order the customer places with reference to this contract will decrease the available quantity of this contract.\\nSo if the customer places an order for 100 units, the open contract quantity becomes 900 units.Note that this only applies if you have set the Update Document Flow checkbox as enabled on the item category in the copy control rules.\\nIf this is not set, the customer can order as much as he would like, without regard to the contract quantity being updated.\\nQuantity contracts can be used to limit the customer’s purchasing; you can block the standard order type for a customer and so force him to use an order type that must be created with reference to a quantity contract.\\nThus, this customer is limited to only ordering 1,000 items.\\nA quantity contract has validity periods and can have cancellation rules.\\nTo create a contract, use the following menu path.Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Contract | [VA41] - Create To make a release order, simply create a standard sales document with reference to the contract. Use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Order | [VA01] - Create After a release order has been created it will automatically decrease the available quantity for the customer. This will be seen when viewing the contract and when creating new orders. Set up the quantity contract by using the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Sales Documents | Sales Document Header | Define Sales Document Types Quantity contracts have their own pricing procedures, texts, partners, and so on, like any other document type. They also have their own item categories. Don’t forget to set up the copy control to other order document types you may be using as release orders.',\n",

For example, in Figure 4-8, the rule 0001 takes the contract cancellation baseline date as the start date of the contract. It then set the rule valid to 12, which is a date rule meaning one week. Within that period of one week, the contract may then be cancelled on any day up to the last day of the one-week period. (The notice value is 1 and the unit is day, therefore the contract may be cancelled up to one day before the end of the week.)\\n | The system uses these settings to automatically enter the validity period and date determination in the contract. This is done by assigning the contract profile to the sales document type representing the contract, for example, WV.\\n | Service and Maintenance Contract Process\\n | The service contract is a legal agreement between the receiver of the service and the business supplying the service. It is used by the business, for example, to initiate automatic billing of routine services at regular intervals and can determine if a cancellation request of the contract is valid. It is used by the receiver of the service as a contract he can claim on, with easy access to requests for service and set prices on specific services.\\n | The standard SAP Sales document type for a service contract is WV.\\n | Generally, a service contract need not have call off or release orders, nor does it need to be created with reference to other sales documents.\\nFor a service and maintenance contract no delivery is necessary because the transaction does not involve the movement of materials.The service contract may have periodic or milestone billing (see Chapter 7) and bill the customer according to a schedule of billing dates.FIGURE 4-8 Deﬁning cancellation rules A service contract integrates with the CS (Customer Service) module in ECC. This permits the CS module to arrange the technicians for the service in accordance with the service contract. Should a service that was not initially part of the original service agreement be completed, it may be billed with a billing request. (Sales Document type LV may be copied.) The item category used by service contracts is very important. It is best to understand the business before you try and customize it. The service item can be any one of the following: • A service task, once off • A material used in the service • Time charged for a technician’s hourly rateThe standard item category for a service is WVN.\\nYou may need additional item categories because of the different types of items available on a service contract.\\nRemember to copy this standard and change the necessary fields.The standard item category has been created to represent a service that is carried out and billed periodically, as seen in Figure 4-9 with billing plan I.The standard item category has a completion rule C, which determines the item to be fully referenced when target quantity is fully reached.\\nThis particular item category is relevant for order-related billing according to a billing plan, as well as utilizing a billing plan type 02, which indicates periodic billing.Copyright by SAP AG',\n",

Master Contracts A master contract is a contract in which you group other contracts as lower-level contracts. Thus the master contract has the general data that is relevant for all lower-level contracts over a specified period.Contracts are grouped in order to ensure all data in the lower-level contracts remains consistent as well as ensuring terms granted in the master contract are copied into all lower- level contracts.The documents that can be grouped under a master contract are • Quantity contracts • Value contracts • Service contractsA master contract contains header data only: The billing plan data, the partners data, business data, and contract data.To understand and configure a master contract, it is important to understand what the business wants from contract grouping.\\nContract grouping is the process whereby several lower-level contracts are linked to one master contract to ensure data consistency.\\nWhen you link a lower-level contract to a master contract the header data of the master contract is passed down into the lower-level contract.\\nFor this to happen the lower-level contract and the higher-level contract must be assigned to the same sales area.\\nNote that you may not assign a hierarchy of contracts together.\\nYou may only have one master contract with many lower-level contracts assigned to it.\\nTo group contracts, you must first determine the referencing requirements.\\nUse the following menu path, as seen in Figure 4-12.\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\n\\n',\n",

You may thus assign a date type and a splitting rule range to each splitting rule, which will allow the system to carry out the splitting rules in sequence.) Proceed by setting up the planning delivery schedule instructions first.\\nThis determines if schedule line categories are relevant for deliveries and how the planning delivery schedules are to be generated.Note schedule lines in the planning delivery schedule replace those in the forecast delivery schedule with regards to planning relevance, and if required, delivery relevance.\\nThe two examples of SAP1 and SAP2, shown in Figure 4-20, are useful in explaining the overview of this functionality.SAP1 indicates that the schedule lines in the planning delivery schedule are relevant for delivery and should replace the schedule lines in the forecast delivery schedule, should their dates lie outside the dates of the JIT delivery schedule.\\nThis is indicated by a check in the checkbox in column D.Copyright by SAP AGFIGURE 4-20 Maintain planning delivery schedule instructions Column B is crucial—it indicates the baseline date used by the system for the planning of delivery schedules.\\nShould no date be entered here, the system will not generate any schedule lines in the planning delivery schedule.\\nYou may select date type 1, which sets the delivery schedule date as the base date, or date type 2, which selects the planning delivery schedule generation as the base date.\\nColumn T represents the date type, for the validity period, of the delivery schedule split.\\nIt is used to indicate if the validity period is measured in weeks or months.\\nThe validity period is the period of time in weeks or months that the delivery schedule split is valid.\\nThe system does not take into account the schedule lines in the forecast delivery schedule, whose date lies after the validity end date.\\nThe associated column Val represents the value in units to determine the end date of the validity period.\\nThus, example SAP2 has a date type of 3, which is months, and a value of 7—that is, 7 months after the baseline date of column B. Column P indicates whether the system should adopt schedule lines from a previous planning delivery schedule when generating a new planning delivery schedule.\\nThis would only be valid for those schedule lines occurring after the validity end date of the delivery schedule split.\\nColumn A indicates if the system should automatically generate a planning delivery schedule when a forecast delivery schedule is created.Copyright by SAP AG',\n",

The correction delivery will update the cumulative quantity in the scheduling agreement, to indicate that the original delivery quantity is still available to be called off in the scheduling agreement.) The usage indicator can be any indicator you set.\\nThe value set here will default into all scheduling agreements at header level and thus be copied into all items.\\nThis is the default usage as found on the line item of the sales document.\\n(This is often a field used in analysis of sales transactions.) The MRP for delivery schedule type defines how the schedule lines are to be controlled.\\nThis value is proposed when creating a scheduling agreement.\\nStandard deliveries are created for the scheduling agreements, thus the delivery type used is LF.The standard billing type is used as well.\\nHowever, just as you may copy and change the sales document types, you may also copy and change the delivery and billing documents should this be necessary.\\n(Refer to Chapter 6 for information on deliveries and Chapter 7 for information on billing.)',\n",

Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Scheduling Agreement | [VA31] - Create Use the standard sales document type LZ. Enter the relevant data such as customer number and material number, as well as the order quantities for the materials. To enter the delivery dates for the item, select the items and select Item | Schedule Lines. Deliveries are automatically created from the schedule lines of the scheduling agreement. These deliveries happen when the delivery due list is run on the same date as the schedule line is relevant for deliveries. You are also able to create the delivery manually using transaction code [VL01] or following the procedures in Chapter 6. Consignment Stock Process With consignment the business allows stock or materials to sit at the customer’s site or allows stock to sit at its own site reserved for the customer. This is done on an agreement that the customer will sell or consume as many of these materials as he can. Only after he has consumed any or sold any and informed the business will the business transfer the stock to the customer’s ownership and issue an invoice. Should the customer not wish to sell or consume any more material, he informs the business and they take the stock back. All requirements transferred from consignment sales orders to materials planning are transferred as individual requirements. This occurs regardless of what the availability checking group setting is on the respective material master record. Consignment stock is monitored in the system by customer and material and the consignment quantity is controlled separately from the available stock for standard sales orders. This type of stock is referred to as special stock. Another form of special stock is returnable packaging. The Consignment Fill-Up When the business delivers stock to a customer on consignment, it is called consignment fill-up. The consignment fill-up uses a standard sales order document type KB. This KB order type is then followed by a standard delivery LF.The consignment fill-up sales document type KB, as well as all other consignment-related sales document types, should have the sales document category setting C (sales order).It is also advisable to use a different number range as you will want consignment sales process to be highlighted as a different sales procedure than the standard sales cycle.It is also advisable not to report on these fill-ups as bookings for statistical purposes, as these fill-ups in no way indicate a sale.\\nThey are just a way to move stock from unrestricted use to the customer’s consignment.\\nTo report on bookings and billings, you should use the consignment issue process.The delivery type used is the standard LF.\\n(Refer to Chapter 3.) The big changes to the standard sales order process are due to the customer not being billed for any of these items.\\nSo no invoice is relevant.\\nThus the sales document type setting for order-related billing and delivery-related billing should be configured as not relevant for billing documents.The item category used as standard for consignment fill-ups, KBN, should be set as not relevant for billing as well as for no pricing.\\nThus the business data of the item category should look similar to Figure 4-23.The item does allow schedule lines.\\nThis is a fundamental element in the consignment process.\\nThe schedule line category determines how deliveries are to perform and what types of goods movements are carried out.\\nThe standard schedule line categories to be used are E0 and E1.Schedule line category E1, as shown in Figure 4-24, is to be used with MRP.\\nIt uses availability checking.',\n",

However, for material determination you need a substitution reason. A substitution reason is a rule that controls the material determination’s execution.\\n | To define substitution reasons, use the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Material Determination | Define Substitution Reasons [OVRQ]\\n | As seen in Figure 5-10, the substitution reason has a four-digit key and description that is used as a reference in the condition record. Attached to this key is a set of rules. The first column is Entry, which controls whether you would like the system to print the name or number of the original material or the substituted materials name or number on the order confirmations.\\n | The next column is the Warning indicator. If checked, it will indicate a warning message to the user that material determination is about to take place. The Strategy column is used to indicate if the substitution should be automatic or if the proposed material determination items should be displayed via a dialog box for selection. The alternatives are • Blank Value Automatic – The item will be replaced • A Substitute products are displayed for selection • B General material determination with selection, without ATP\\n | FIGURE 5-10\\n | Deﬁning substitution reasons\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | When using material determination you may enter the material to be swapped in the standard Material Entered column of the sales order. However, when using the customer - material information record you may only enter the customer’s material in the Customer Material field of the sales order. Should you be using material determination to indicate automatic swapping of the customer number automatically one to one, be careful not to use the customer material information record, as this may confuse the user as to where he should enter the data.\\n | The automatic substitution that happens in the background only occurs according to the availability check (if you select as a sub-item). Suppose you have four products for the system to do an automatic substitution on, and you have stock of one of them but not the other three. The system will propose and consume that one for which you have stock. This can cause problems, because if this one material is procured correctly, due to there being a demand for it, it may automatically fill up, causing a continual cycle where only this material is ever used and the other three are not consumed. The Outcome column allows you to select whether the proposed item from material determination should automatically replace the existing material or if it should be displayed as a sub-item in the sales order.\\n | Remember, if you use the outcome sub-items be sure to configure your item category determination correctly. That is, the main item that is being substituted should have the usage indicator PSHP (product selection higher level item) and the sub-item material that is being displayed as a sub-item should have the usage indicator PSEL.

Save your data.FIGURE 5-16 Create a condition record for A001.When creating the sales order the system will first check to see if the material the customer is ordering is allowed for the sales area the order is placed in.\\nThen it checks to see if the material is excluded for that customer and lastly it checks to see if the material is on a list of allowed materials for the respective customer.\\nThe system will check the listing and exclusion of the Sold-to Party first.\\nIf it does find a listing or exclusion for the sold to party, it does not check further; however, should it not find an entry for the Sold-to Party, it then proceeds to check if a listing or exclusion is created for the payer.\\nShould no entry exist for either the Sold-to Party or the payer partner roles of the customer master record, the customer may order any product that is created in the sales area for which the order is being created.\\n\\nMaterials Requirements Planning and Transfer of Requirements\\nDuring sales order creation, a line item in the sales order may create a schedule line.\\nThe schedule line represents the customer’s requested delivery date and quantity to be delivered.\\nThis information is transferred (transfer of requirements) to materials requirements planning (MRP).\\nMRP is then able to determine if there is enough quantity of stock available for the scheduled delivery date.\\nThe transfer of requirements aims to ensure that the materials ordered are ready for the requested delivery date.\\nThe transfer of requirements is closely integrated with the Materials Management (MM) and Production Planning (PP) modules, which are both part of Logistics within the SAP ERP Central Component of SAP.\\nThus transfer of requirements must be closely configured in association with the respective logistics teams.To configure transfer of requirements, use the following menu path.\\n\\nFunctions | Availability Check and Transfer of Requirements | Transfer of Requirements\\nAs described earlier, the schedule lines in the sales order transfer the requirements through to MRP.\\nYou are able to select for which documents you would like the transfer of requirements to happen.\\nFor example, you may not wish any transfer of requirements to happen for quotations.\\nHowever, you may want the transfer of requirements to happen for standard sales orders.\\n\\n\\nIndividual or Collective Requirements\\nThe transfer of requirements can either be a transfer of requirements with an individual requirement or a transfer of requirements with collective requirements.\\nThis is set in the Availability check field on the material master record in the Sales: General/Plant view.\\nUse transaction code [MM01] - to create a material and transaction code [MM02] - to change a material master record Not only does this control how the availability check is processed, but also how the requirements are transferred to MRP.\\n',\n",

The MRP type is used in the material master to determine how a material is planned—for example, automatic reorder point planning, manual reorder point planning, forecast-based planning, no planning, etc. There is a pre-defined search strategy that the system uses to determine the requirements type as follows:\\n | 1. First, an attempt is made to find a requirements type using the strategy group in the material master.\\n | 2. Then if the strategy group has not been maintained, the system will determine it using the MRP group.\\n | 3. If, however, the MRP group has not been defined, the system uses the material type instead of the MRP group when accessing the corresponding control tables.\\n | 4. If no requirements type is found, the system assumes a special rule and attempts to find a requirements type by the item category and the MRP type.\\n | 5. If this is not possible, a final attempt is made to find a requirements type with the item category only.\\n | 6. If the final attempt fails, the system declares the transaction as not relevant for the availability check or transfer of requirements.\\n | Should you not want this strategy to be used to search for a requirements type, but instead you would like the system to immediately determine the requirements type based on the item category and MRP type as you assigned them, you may select an alternative search strategy in the column next to the one where you assign the requirements type, as shown in Figure 5-22. For this particular example you would select 1, which determines that the source is used as the item type and MRP type strategy.\\n | Defining Procedure for Each Schedule Line Category\\n | Once this assignment has been made proceed to the menu path for - Define Procedure For Each Schedule Line Category.\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Availability Check and Transfer of Requirements | Transfer of Requirements | Define Procedure For Each Schedule Line Category As discussed previously, the transfer of requirements and the availability check can be fine-tuned at the schedule line category level.

However, in some cases you may need to block a transaction—for example, due to a bad result of the credit check. In cases where the transaction is blocked, the requirement still sits in MRP and still reserves a quantity. This often is unfavorable, thus you may indicate here that the system does not reserve the stock. It will still transfer the requirement to MRP, however, it will not reserve the quantity. You are able to set a limit to the number of days you would want the system to postpone this block on confirmation of requirements. This may be carried out by setting a number of days to the block, in the Def Period column.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | This postponement period will only affect the order confirmation if the postponement falls within the confirmation period. For example, should a material be ordered on 10/01 and confirmed for 10/02 and the period for the block is 10 days, the resulting confirmed date would be 10/11. On the other hand, however, should the original schedule line be confirmed in 20 days, thus 10/21, the block would have no affect on the sales order.\\n | Maintaining Requirements for Transfer of Requirements\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Availability Check and Transfer of Requirements | Transfer of Requirements | Maintain Requirements For Transfer Of Requirements In the same way that requirements are used in access sequences—that is, a number of preconditions must exist for the transaction to be carried out—requirements may also be used to determine that the transfer of requirements to MRP is not carried out unless a number of conditions are met.\\n | You are also able to set requirements on the implementation guide menu path.\\n | FIGURE 5-25\\n | Transfer of requirements block deferment setting\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Availability Check and Transfer of Requirements | Transfer of Requirements | Maintain requirements for purchase and assembly orders In standard sales order processing a purchase order may need to be created in order to meet the demands of the customer. This purchase order is used to purchase new stock in order to meet the demand on MRP for a particular customer’s sales order. Here you define requirements that must be met in order for the purchase order or assembly order to be created. An example is the standard SAP requirement 101, which will stop a purchase order or assembly order from being created should a credit block exist on the sales order.\\n | This completes the SD module’s aspects of configuring the transfer of requirements. The transfer of requirements is closely associated with the availability check. They should be planned and configured at the same time. The transfer of requirements and availability check are closely associated with credit management as well. For example, if a sales order is locked by credit management, all subsequent processing, such as delivery, is supposed to be stopped. For this purpose, the confirmation in the schedule lines is reset.\\n | Regarding credit management and standard Transfer of Requirements - the requested schedule line passes a requirement in spite of the credit management, credit control block, however the confirmation of the requirement can be configured to be unconfirmed as in standard. This requirement is also processed from the MRP run and the procurement is triggered. The credit lock doe',\n",

In both cases, the procurement element is created directly from the sales order (the purchase requisition in the case of the third-party order processing and the production order, planned order, or the like in the case of the assembly processing).\\n | The credit block in the sales order prevents the creation of the procurement element. However if the credit block is first set during the change of a sales order, the procurement element is deleted again. As long as the credit block is set in the sales order, no procurement or production occurs for this sales order. If a sales order is released from the credit block, an availability check is carried out again for this order. The availability check tries to confirm the requested quantities. In case of the direct procurement, a purchase requisition or a production order is created again in the background.\\n | It is possible in some instances that the subsequent operations and purchase requisitions that have been used may not have been deleted. For example, in a service order, they may have simply been locked, as all processes should be on hold due to the credit block. When the document is released, a new document (for example, a new service order) may be created to continue the process. The first service order and the new service order now relate to a single sales document. (If you are interested, service documents would be obtainable from transaction code [IW39] - List of All Service Orders.)\\n | Availability Check\\n | The availability check forms an integral part of the business sales process. It determines if the requested delivery quantity can be available for shipping in order to meet the customer’s requested delivery date.\\n | The availability check is carried out at a Plant level. It results in a material availability date. This represents the date the system has determined the requested material will be available. Added to this date is the pick pack time, the loading time, and the transportation scheduling time, which may or may not be added, depending on how long it is. All of these dates result in a planned goods issue date, which is the planned date the goods are transferred from the business’ ownership and control, possibly to a shipping agent. The shipping dates are then added to the goods issue date, resulting in a delivery date. This automatically determined delivery date is then communicated to the customer when the sales order is placed.\\n | Terminology Used in the Availability Check\\n | Backorder processing is the processing of a backorder, which in itself is a sales order that has not been confirmed in full or not confirmed at a certain delivery date.\\n | Rescheduling is a proposal of how confirmed quantities already assigned to sales orders may be reassigned to other orders that have a higher priority—for example, an earlier requested delivery date.\\n | ATP is an acronym for “availability to promise,” which is the basis of the availability check. The system is able to automatically calculate the available quantity to promise or commit to a sales document based upon a number of rules that we shall define later.\\n | ATP takes into account all movements into and out of the warehouse.\\n | The stock examined for ATP may be safety stock, stock in transfer, stock in quality inspection, and blocked stock. The planned receipts and planned issues of the stock associated with ATP may be purchase orders, purchase requisitions, planned orders, production orders, reservations, dependent reservations, dependent requirements, sales requirements, and delivery requirements.\\n | If the business produces special stock, such as made-to-order goods or consignment stock, the ATP check may be carried out against the special stock.\\n | Replenishment lead time is the time needed to produce the requested stock.

Replenishment lead time is only used when doing an ATP check.\\n | The value of the replenishment lead time for a material is specified on the material master record. It may be determined in one of two ways:\\n | • The replenishment lead time for an externally procured material is determined based on the total of the processing time for purchasing, the planned delivery time, and the goods receipt processing time. These settings may be made on the Purchasing and MRP 2 views of the material master record.\\n | • The replenishment lead time for an internally procured material is based on the in-house production time, seen on the MRP 2 view as well as the goods receipt processing time, or alternatively if set, from the total replenishment lead time, which is found in the material master record on the MRP 3 view.\\n | If a sales order is created and there is no available stock and the ATP check is set to include replenishment lead time, the system will automatically confirm the desired quantity for the end of replenishment lead time based on whether the material is externally or internally procured. Thus should you have an order for 100,000 pieces of material xyz and the system has no available stock, it will still give a confirmed date according to the end of the lead time. Should there be partial stock available, the system will confirm this partial quantity and move the remaining quantity to the end of replenishment lead time. It does not do an availability check outside of the replenishment lead time. If replenishment lead time is three days for a specific material, it will not do an availability check outside of those three days as it automatically thinks it will definitely have stock on the fourth day. To examine stock on hand you may use the availability overview, proceed with the menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Environment |\\n | Availability Overview\\n | Transaction code [CO09] To examine stock on hand from a created order, proceed in order change mode [VA02] to the schedule line, then select the menu path Environment | Availability. There are three types of availability checks:\\n | • The availability check on the basis of the ATP quantities as previously described.\\n | • The availability check against product allocation, with which one is able to do an availability check against product allocation, allowing a predefined distribution quantity of products to customers.\\n | • The third availability check takes place in the stand-alone APO (Advanced Planner and Optimizer) planning system from SAP.\\n | Basic Elements of the Availability Check\\n | We now have enough background into the availability process to configure the logic behind ATP.\\n | Checking Groups\\n | The checking group defines what type of requirements we will pass on. Do we record summarized requirements—that is, daily or weekly summed up requirements in the stock requirements list? Or do we record individual requirements—that is, a line for each sales order and line item and schedule line in the stock requirement list? The advantages of individual requirements over summarized requirements are as follows:\\n | • Backorder processing is possible for individual processing.\\n | • We can access the order and line items and schedule lines in the stock requirements list [MD04]. This gives one greater control over the available stock and the requirements placed on the stock.\\n | The disadvantages are • There may be slightly more impact on system performance as each demand is placed immediately into the stock requirements list.\\n | Do not forget the system automatically uses individual requirements for special stock movements such as consignment stock, returnable packaging, etc., even if summarized requirements have been selected.\\n | The checking groups are configurable.

Should it not be able to confirm stock for the requested delivery date, it will confirm a value of zero. Complete Delivery The system will only confirm a delivery date on a date when the entire scheduled ordered quantity for that line in the sales order is available. For example, should the quantity ordered be 100 pce for an order on January 1st with a requested delivery date of January 1st and you have 90 pce available, the system will wait until 100 pce may be confirmed, which may be at the end of lead time for the material.

       "  'chunk_text': 'Logistics Execution Process\\nHere we configure deliveries, transportation, routes, and determination as well as packaging.\\nThis chapter deals with copy control, picking, simple warehouse management processes, and special stock.\\n\\nDelivery Process\\nThe delivery process is a continuation from the sales process.\\nIt is generally used in outbound processing to move goods from the plant to the shipping vendor to the customer.\\nHowever, the returns process of inbound deliveries is also included as a standard SAP delivery process, where instead of “posting goods issue” for outbound deliveries, we “post goods receipt” for an inbound flow of products back into our plant.\\nA delivery document can be created with reference to a sales document such as an order or a scheduling agreement (which was discussed in Chapter 4).\\nOr it may be created, for example, with reference to an inbound return sales document.In mySAP ERP, the shipping functions have been removed from the Sales and Distribution section of the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide.\\nInstead, they have been placed in the Logistics Execution section.\\nHowever, it is critical that the people responsible for the SD module understand this topic.\\n\\nDelivery Document Configuration\\nA delivery document type is similar to the sales order document type.\\nWhereas in the sales process the sales document structure and control were defined largely by the sales document type, in the delivery process the delivery document type controls how the delivery is to function.\\nThe structure of the delivery document is very similar to a sales document type in that a delivery document has a header and item structure.\\nThe output of an SAP delivery is a goods movement.\\n\\n\\nDefining Delivery Types\\nThe SAP delivery document is usually the step subsequent to a sales document type and preceding a billing document.\\nHowever, a delivery is not restricted to being created from a sales document type.\\nUse the following menu path.\\n\\n\\nDeliveries | Define Delivery Types [0VLK]\\nThe delivery document type, shown in Figure 6-1, has fewer control settings than the sales document type.\\nThe associated settings of the delivery document type are as follows:• Document Category This is a critical field that identifies to the system what document type is being used.\\nIt is used in internal table controls, for example, to determine system responses and messages.• Number Systems Here you assign the particular number range that your delivery will follow, as well as the item increment in the delivery document type.You may create the number ranges relevant for delivery documents by selecting SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | Deliveries | Define Number Ranges for Deliveries [VN01] After creating the interval, you may assign your delivery document number range to the document type.\\n(See Chapter 3 for more information on number ranges.) • Order Reference With this setting enabled, you can create this delivery without reference to a sales document type.\\nYou must specify a “pseudo” sales documents type in the Default Order Type field.\\nThis will cause the system to use the control data set for this referenced pseudo document type.\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nFIGURE 6-1 Deﬁne delivery document type\\nWhen it is necessary to have a specific goods movement assigned to a delivery that has no sales document type used as a reference, your pseudo sales document type must have an item category followed by an assigned schedule line category.\\nIt is this schedule line category that must have the assigned goods movement.\\nHere’s an example of a pseudo sales document: The warehouse asks for a specific delivery, which must not be created from a sales order but is to use a special goods movement type.\\nThis goods movement type—for example, 901—is used to show the return of stock to a supplier.1. You would configure this by copying a standard delivery type such as LF, and naming it ZLF.2. Then you would copy a sales document type such as TA and name it ZTA.3. Next you would copy an item category TAN and name it ZTAN.4. Finally you would copy a schedule line category such as CP and name it ZCP.\\nAssigned to this schedule line category would be the movement type 901.5. You would then assign the sales document type ZTA to the delivery type ZLF as the default order type.',\n",

The availability check in the delivery is still carried out and controlled by the delivery item category regardless of whether the delivery item category has the same name as the item it is referenced from in the sales order, or if it is determined in the delivery. The delivery item category determination is especially useful for assigning batch items to standard delivery items. For example, should you carry out batch determination in the delivery, you are able to assign a delivery item category to an item that has a usage defined as CHSP- batch split. (This will create a delivery line item for each batch, even if the product on the delivery is the same and was represented by a single sales document line item.) Don’t forget you can view the usages of the item category in table TVVWT, which may be easier than looking at each in configuration individually.\\n | Defining a Delivery Item Category Continued\\n | The delivery item category is represented by the following settings as seen in Figure 6-3. The item category is assigned to a document category; in this case the document category is for deliveries, represented as a “J.”\\n | • The Material Number 0 Allowed field is used to permit the item to be created without having a reference to a material reference. This is used in examples for text items, where one creates a line item with a special item category and types text in the description of the material description.\\n | • The statistics group for the item category is used to generate statistics in the logistics information system.\\n | • The stock determination rule is used in conjunction with the stock determination group to determine the stock determination strategy.\\n\\n• The Check Quantity of 0 field specifies whether you can create an item that has a zero quantity and, if you do, how it is to react with a warning or error message or no message at all.• The Check Minimum Quantity field is a check carried out against the minimum delivery quantity on the material master record and the customer material information record.\\nThe response from the system can be a warning or an error message.• It is possible to create an over-delivery, thus the Check Over Delivery indicator is used to display a warning message or an error message should the delivery quantity exceed the limit in the customer material information record or the sales order quantity.• The Availability Check Off indicator allows you to turn off the availability check for a delivery item.',\n",

This item is then available in the picking list and to be transferred to warehouse management. It would not be advisable to make all items relevant for picking; for example, you would not pick service items such as a technicians hours. Generally, unless you do physical picking from the warehouse, you do not need picking. Picking is therefore not required for non-stock, value, and service items. • The Storage Location Required field indicates a storage location must be entered for this item before the delivery can be completely processed. Likewise, the Determine Storage Location field is an indicator used by the system to indicate automatic determination of the storage location for the delivery item. The Don’t Check Storage Location field is used to stop the system from checking that the material exists in the storage location that was determined. • The No Batch Check field ensures the system does not check to determine if the batch entered in the delivery line item exists in the system or not. Thus, should you enter a batch in the line item when the batch is not in the system, the system will accept it anyway.The Automatic Batch Determination field tells the system to carry out automatic batch determination in the delivery for this line item.\\n(Automatic batch determination can happen at the line item level in the sales order or the delivery.) • The Text Determination Procedure field is not maintainable and will be covered in “Text Determination” in Chapter 9.• The Standard Text field is not used in ERP ECC6.\\n\\nDelivery Due List\\nThe delivery due list is used to create delivery documents en masse automatically as opposed to individually.\\nA number of companies have a specific emergency shipping point for their delivery due list to create emergency deliveries.\\nA variant is then created for this shipping point and is executed on a much shorter time scale than ordinary delivery document creation.\\nWhen one deals with delivery creation, one must be aware of the fiscal requirements of the country in which you are operating.\\nSome countries do not permit a sales order to be broken up into more than one delivery, and likewise they may not permit more than one sales document to be combined into one delivery.\\nThe item categories of a delivery are referenced from the sales order; for example, item category TAN in the sales order proposes item category TAN in the delivery.The SAP standard version uses DLN as the standard item category used to represent an item in a delivery without reference to a sales order.One is also able to define a delivery split according to specific criteria in the copy control rules.\\nIn the formation of the data transfer one may set up splitting criteria.\\nSplitting criteria and the usage of ZUK is covered in “Pricing” later in Chapter 8.One may execute the delivery due list by using the following transaction codes.\\n(Note that the transaction code VL04 should no longer be used after SAP 4.0b.) | [VL10A] | Sales orders fast display\\n | [VL10B] | Purchase orders fast display\\n | [VL10C] | Sales orders items\\n | [VL10D] | Purchase orders items\\n | [VL10E] | Sales orders schedule lines\\n | [VL10F] | Purchase orders item schedule line\\n | [VL10G] | Sales and purchase orders fast display\\n | [VL10H] | Sales and purchase orders items fast display\\n | [VL10I] | Sales and purchase orders item schedule line\\nAlthough the processing program is the same for all transaction codes, the control is determined by the role defined in [VL10CUA] and scenario defined in [VL10CUV] as found on the User Role tab.',\n",

Whether that location be a physical or a systemic location, no delivery may be made without a shipping point. The shipping point is determined by the system based on the shipping conditions, which are either entered manually in the sales order or copied from the customer master record. (Shipping conditions may also be copied from the sales document type if not maintained on the customer master.) The loading group, which is copied from the material master record, and the delivering plant of the line item in the sales order are also shipping conditions.

These settings are then copied into the sales document during order creation and are used to determine the shipping point. The shipping conditions may be manually changed in the sales order, or they may be defaulted to a particular sales document type. Should they be defaulted to a particular sales document type, the system will ignore the setting on the customer master record. Proceed with copying a shipping condition and changing the name to represent your requirements, using the prefix Z. The shipping condition is a two-character alphanumeric key, as seen in Figure 6-7. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | Basic Shipping Functions | Shipping Point and Goods Receiving Point Determination| Define Shipping Conditions by Sales Document Type As discussed earlier, the shipping conditions defined by sales document type override the shipping conditions automatically proposed by the system from the customer master record. This is useful, for example, in returns. In returns processing a returns delivery must be made with a shipping point that represents the incoming goods. It would not be recommended to use the same shipping point for returns or receiving goods as you do for outgoing deliveries. Thus you may assign all returns sales document types their own returns shipping condition and thus promote a returns shipping point.\\n',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'elivery.\\n | First, not all items are relevant for picking. You may have items such as text items or return items that are not picking-relevant. Picking is always carried out from a particular storage location, so for a delivery to be picking-relevant, a storage location must always be entered. If interfacing with warehouse management, the storage location in the delivery determines which storage location to use in the warehouse. Picking is configured using the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping |\\n | Picking\\n | Defining Relevant Item Categories\\n | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | Picking| Define Relevant Item Categories Here you indicate to the system which item categories are relevant for picking. This indicator may either be set here, or when defining the delivery item category. Should the item not be relevant for picking, it is not necessary to have a storage location determined for the item either. Thus when creating the delivery item category, you would not need to indicate “determine storage location” or “storage location required.”\\n | Interface with Warehouse Management\\n | If you have defined a warehouse in SAP and assigned it to a storage location, and you use this storage location in a delivery, then you must use Warehouse Management to do the picking for that delivery.\\n | Warehouse Management is a module in its own right. In this section I’ll introduce you to simple warehouse management processes.\\n | The process for placing goods in the warehouse is as follows: The goods are received into the interim storage area for goods receipts (for example, from production). A transfer order is then created in WM to move the goods into the warehouse. This tells the warehouse staff where to put the stock. When the stock is put into the warehouse in the correct place, the transfer order is confirmed, which tells SAP that the goods have been moved out of the interim storage area (i.e., the loading and unloading area) into the warehouse.\\n | The process for extracting the goods from the warehouse is as follows: You can create a transfer order [LT03] from the delivery, and SAP will choose stock from the warehouse to be delivered. This choice is based on a number of inventory methods, such as LIFO (last in, first out) and FIFO (first in, first out). The transfer order will instruct the warehouse staff where to get the stock from, and to deliver it to the interim storage area for goods issues.\\n | Once all the stock has been picked, the transfer order is confirmed [LT12], which informs the system that the stock has been taken out of the warehouse and made available for loading in a loading bay or other such place.\\n | If you created the transfer order from a sales delivery, SAP will confirm that the delivery has been picked when you confirm that you have fulfilled the stock quantity in the transfer order.\\n | During confirmation of the transfer order [LT12], select Pick Quantity 2. This will result in the system automatically picking and post goods issuing the delivery document.\\n | The order can now be loaded onto the truck, and the goods issued.\\n | Should picking be done using Warehouse Management, once the delivery is created, you need to create a transfer order. To create a transfer order from the delivery from within the delivery select, select Subsequent Functions | Create Transfer Order. It is also possible to create a transfer order for a delivery by using the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Menu | Logistics| Sales and Distribution| Shipping and Transportation |\\n | Picking | Create Transfer Order | [LT03] - Single Document\\n | After the transfer order number has been created, it is necessary to confirm the transfer order by selecting Shipping and ',\n",

The storage condition refers to the storage of the material in the plant or warehouse. It is found on the Plant Data/Warehouse 1 tab of the material master record.\\n | Defining Rules for Picking Location\\n | To define rules for the picking location, use the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping |\\n | Picking | Determine Picking Location | Define Rules for Picking Location Determination\\n | The entry maintained here is copied into the delivery header data. This entry here allows the system to determine the storage location automatically, should the storage location not have been maintained in the delivery manually. Proceed in assigning a storage location rule—for example, MALA—to the delivery document type. (As previously discussed storage location rules, for example MALA are covered by materials and warehouse management modules and are not in scope for this book.)\\n | Defining Storage Conditions\\n | Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping |\\n | Picking| Determine Picking Locations | Define Storage Conditions\\n | The storage condition is a two-character alphanumeric key that is used by the system to indicate the storage conditions for a material.

The system bases the automatic determination of the storage location on the combination of the determination rule MALA assigned to the delivery document type with the shipping point and the delivering plant plus the storage condition on the material master record, as seen in\\n | FIGURE 6-9 Storage location determination\\n | Backward and Forward Scheduling\\n | The customer specifies a requested delivery date that is placed into the schedule line of the sales order. The business must determine if it is able to carry out the associated functions in procuring the requested quantity and delivering it to the customer by the requested delivery date in the sales order.\\n | The business functions required to be performed before a delivery date may be met are the following:\\n | • Time taken to procure materials, such as obtaining materials from a supplier\\n | • Time taken to plan the transportation, such as obtaining space on a ship\\n | • Time taken to pick the items\\n | • Time taken to pack the items\\n | • Time taken to load the materials\\n | • Time taken to transport the materials to the customer This process of scheduling the business process from the requested delivery date backward in order to meet a specified delivery date is called backward scheduling and is illustrated in Figure 6-10.\\n | For example, suppose you have a sales document with a requested delivery date on the 20th of January for a sales order placed on the 14th of January. The system carries out backward scheduling from the date of the requested delivery date:\\n | • Let’s say the transit time (the time taken to move the materials to the customer’s site) is four days.\\n | • The loading time in the warehouse is one day.\\n | • The transportation lead time is one day (the time taken to schedule the containers, shipping companies, etc. to move the materials, which usually falls into the time taken for the material to become available).\\n | • We now sit at a delivery date of January 20th less four days, less another one day, less anot',\n",

Then select your destination point—for example, an airfield—which is also a connection point as previously defined. Proceed with a new entry and continue with the assignments. Now that the route has been defined, you are able to proceed with an optional step of maintaining the stages for the routes. This would have been carried out for each individual leg. However, once you have many routes in the system and you need to define some “global” changes, you may proceed to the Maintain Stages for All Routes screen. This can be done by using the following menu path: Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic Functions | Routes| Define Routes| Maintain Stages For All Routes In the selection screen enter the data you wish to change. For this example, I have entered all stages defined as transport legs for route 000001, WHICH offers me the transport legs seen in Figure 6-24.One is now able to expand these legs and select all of them.\\nYou will notice a red traffic light.\\nAfter selecting them all, click on the Change button (shown with the pencil icon).FIGURE 6-24 Multiple route maintenance This will offer you a number of attributes, which you may now select and change. These changes will be assigned to all the originally selected legs. For example, one can set the shipping type to truck. Click the Execute button. You will notice the traffic signal is displayed as yellow. After again selecting all of the items and clicking Save, you will notice the traffic signal indicates green. This signaling is merely there for one to use as an indicator of which items have been processed and which are still to be processed when working with a very large number of entries. Now that the routes have been maintained, you are able to proceed with defining the route determination. Route Determination We have defined the route. Now one needs to define how the route is determined in the system. Route determination occurs in the SAP system based on the following items: • The country and departure zone (taken from the shipping point) • The country and receiving zone of the Ship-to Party • The shipping conditions as in the sales order • The transportation group of the material master record • The weight group (optional and only relevant in the delivery) FIGURE 6-25 Changed routesThe system then copies the route as proposed in the sales order into the delivery document header.The route already determined in the sales order and copied into the delivery may be redetermined in the delivery document.\\nThis redetermination may use the weight of the materials and must be indicated for each relevant delivery document types in customizing.\\nProceed to the Define Transportation Zones screen.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Billing\\nIn this chapter we progress to the implementation of and interfacing with billing documents, and continue the contract process of different billing plans.\\nWe also introduce resource billing related to customer service.\\n\\nBilling Process\\nThe business is able to invoice the customer for materials or services rendered.\\nGenerally, this takes place after the delivery process has been completed, whether this is a delivery of a physical item or a service.\\nThe billing process could be order- or delivery-related, and may include billing of standard deliveries as well as the creation of debit and credit memos.\\nThe billing process may even include invoicing for financial deposits for large projects prior to construction and inception of the project.\\n\\n\\nDefining Billing Document Types\\nThe billing document is similar to the delivery document in that it has a header and item level, but no schedule line level, as in the sales documents.\\nThus one must configure the header document type and the relevant item categories.\\nTo define the billing document type, use the following menu path.\\n\\nBilling Documents | Define Billing Types | Define Billing Types\\nYou may maintain a billing document type or create your own by copying and changing the billing type key.\\nRemember when creating your own document types to use the name range beginning with the prefix of Z.\\nThe header data of a billing document defines how the document is to behave.\\nIt has the standard number range assignments.\\nHowever, note that the billing document only uses internal assignments.\\nIt is not possible to have an external number range for a billing document.\\nThe billing document is split up into control sections, which I’ll cover next.\\n\\nThe General Control Data\\nThe general control data, shown in Figure 7-1, includes the sales document category, which defines what type of document the system is using.\\nThe SAP standard for invoice is M. (You will remember the standard for a delivery is J, etc.) The posting block stops automatic release of the billing document to accounting.\\nThis means the billing document must be manually released to accounting by selecting Billing | Change | Release to Accounting from the billing document.\\nThe statistics checkbox indicates if this billing document is relevant for updating the information systems such as the sales information systems (SIS).Billing document type general control dataOne must also assign a transaction group 7 for billing documents and 8 for pro forma invoices.The billing category is a further sub-division of billing document type and transaction group.\\nThis category is used for selection of screen variants and classifications.The document type is used when the accounting document is created.The negative posting is only effective if the company code for which the posting is carried out permits negative postings.\\n(In reality it is rarely used.) The branch/head office is important as it determines which customer master record is used to update the accounting documents.\\nGenerally, if the payer is different than the Sold-to Party, the payer is transferred to Financial Accounting as the customer.The credit memo with value data checkbox is used for credit memos, to set the baseline date as the date from the original billing document.The invoice list type represents the document type that may be used to create invoice lists for this billing document.\\nYou may also state that such a billing document is related to the rebate process by indicating what rebate type of document it is in the rebate settlement field.If the document is relevant for rebate accruals, you need to indicate it by checking the relevant for rebate checkbox.The standard text field is currently not used.\\n\\nThe Cancellation Data\\nThe cancellation data, as seen in Figure 7-2, is used by the system when a document type of the type you are defining is cancelled.\\nThe system will automatically use the cancellation billing type as well as any copying requirements you maintain here.\\nCancellation of sales documents seldom occurs, in standard business practice, instead, a credit or debit note is generally given.\\nThe Credit or Debit note may be issued for the discrepancy or alternatively a Credit note may be issued for the entire invoice, followed by a recreation of the billing document for the correct amount.\\n',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Billing > Special Billing Document Types > Pro Forma Invoice\\nThe pro forma invoice uses the billing type F8.\\nIt is an invoice that does not post any financial amounts into any general ledger.\\nIt is used for information purposes only—for example, to accompany the shipment of products across a border post, thus being used to represent the actual value of the articles.\\nThe actual invoice may be sent to the customer via post.Another example of the use of a pro forma invoice would be the invoice representing the value a customer must claim from a superior authority before the business sends him the actual payable invoice.\\n\\nCancellation Invoice\\nA standard cancellation invoice is billing type S1.\\nThe cancellation invoice is used when a billing document is found to have errors in it, and the original billing document needs to be cancelled and recreated.\\nNote that it is illegal in a number of countries to permit this capability in a system, so be careful copying the standard billing document type F2, as you may wish to exclude this functionality.\\n\\nInter-company Invoice\\nThis billing document type, which will be discussed in more detail later, represents the internal invoice used between two company codes belonging to the same business.\\nIt is an internal invoice in the sense that it is not passed on to any external Sold-to Party or partner.\\nAn inter-company sale refers to a sales transaction where more than one company code belonging to the business is used in the process.\\nAn intra-company sale refers to a transaction within one company code, such as intra-company stock transfers, where stock is moved between two plants within a single company code.\\n\\n\\nCollective Billing and Copy Control for Billing Documents\\nA billing document may be created individually or collectively.\\nWe’ll examine how to control billing document creation, keeping in mind the copy control rules and the master data.\\n\\n\\nIntroduction to Collective Billing\\nBilling documents may be created individually.\\nThat is, you may create an invoice for each sales order or billing document.\\nBilling documents may also be created as collective billing documents.\\nInvoices can be accumulated and created collectively—for example, on one day of the week, when all relevant data is equal, the system may combine multiple deliveries or sales document into one invoice.\\nThis is done by using a combination of the factory calendar assigned to the payer master record and the billing copying rules.To create collective invoicing for a customer, you must first define the billing factory calendar the payer is using.\\n(Refer to “Factory Calendars” in Chapter 9.) This factory calendar is then assigned to the billing view of the customer master record for the payer.\\nThe billing calendar may indicate one day of the week as a working day, thus the system will only propose to create billing documents for this party once a week.However, this does not mean that the deliveries and sales orders will be consolidated into one billing document.\\nThe copy control may require the invoices to be split (for example, if the payment terms are different).\\nBut it does mean that the billing documents will be created on that day.\\nWe will look at the splitting criteria a little later in this section.\\n\\nIntroduction to Copy Control for Billing Documents\\nThe copy control for billing documents is split into three overall copy control rules.\\nThey define copy rules for header and item levels between sales documents.\\n• Sales document to billing document This is used, for example, for credit memos and debit memos that have no delivery document.Billing document to billing document This is used by the system to determine copying control, for example, between an invoice and an inter-company invoice.• Delivery document to billing document This is the most widely used copying rule, which covers the standard sales process.As the copy control definition and maintenance is equal for all three types, we will only use the delivery document to billing document copy control rule as an example.Billing Document Copy Control Rules: Delivery Document to Billing Document Use the following menu path.',\n",

Of these five sales orders, we have created two deliveries due to the fact that the shipping point on one of the sales orders was different. (Three sales orders could be on one delivery document and two on the other, or four on one delivery document and one on the other.) Now we have the scenario whereby two deliveries of delivery type LF are to be billed. Looking at the copy control rules from delivery type LF to billing document type F2, as seen in Figure 7-5, we may select the relevant copy control rules. Select the document types, then click the Details button (the small magnify glass) in the taskbar. You will see a screen similar to Figure 7-6. The target and source document types are self-explanatory. The copying requirements assign a number, which in turn is the key to a routine. The routine may be found in transaction code [VOFM] (Menu path: Copying Requirements | Billing Documents). We’ll discuss more about VOFM later. The routine 003, which actually includes LV60A003, is used to check specific blocks and statuses to determine if the billing document may be created. The blocks and statuses it checks are as follows:\\n | • Billing block\\n | • Billing status\\n | • Goods movement status\\n | • Incompletion status for billing header\\n | • Overall incompletion status for billing document\\n | • POD (proof of delivery) status\\n | The determine export data field is used to redetermine the export control (foreign trade data) automatically in the billing document. The reference number is passed to accounting. The allocation number is similar to the reference number. Both of these numbers may have defaults assigned to them on the billing document type.\\n | For self-billing, the value of this field must be equal to a “C,” meaning the delivery number is used as a reference. However, this also means that the delivery number will be passed to accounting as the reference field. The system therefore cannot combine deliveries like in a collective invoice as it does not know what number to use as a reference.\\n | Copyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 7-6 | Billing header copy control\\n | FIGURE 7-5 | Header target and source copy control\\nThe assignment number on table VBRK (VBRK-ZUONR) is actually the allocation number in the copy control at header level.\\nIf you set this field to check, for example, your sales document or delivery document, you will not be able to collectively bill documents as the value of this VBRK field will be different.\\n\\nBilling Document Copy Control Item\\nSelect the Item folder in the file structure on the left.\\nYou will then see a screen similar to Figure 7-7.\\nSelect item category TAN, as shown in Figure 7-7, then click the Details button and you’ll see a screen similar to Figure 7-8.Using the example of TAN, as seen in Figure 7-8, we have a similar view to the copy control rules as seen in the sales documents.The billing quantity is used to determine the quantity of items to be invoiced—for example, setting B indicates to invoice the delivery quantity less the already invoiced quantity.The positive/negative quantity field is used to update the open/remaining quantity or value in the source document.',\n",

Should a customer wish to have consolidated invoicing, his billing schedule date must resemble the dates he wishes to be billed on, and he must realize he will have his invoice split according to the splitting requirements set globally, not according to his individual requirements.\\nThe invoice split is defined per combination of document type and is not relevant to be configured per customer master or partner.\",\n",

The selection date is required when you are invoicing billing plans. For example, let’s say you manually enter the contract to be billed, and it has billing dates in the past and future. The system will automatically bill all the dates unless you specify the end date or “selection date.” This is found by selecting (from [VF01]) Settings | Selection Date. or by pressing SHIFT-F7. Self-Billing Self-billing is generally used by large automotive companies. It is the process whereby a company who purchases your goods sends you an invoice, which actually represents the invoice you intend to send them for the goods you sent them. To use the self-billing process, use the following menu path.

The verification level is a key indicator that determines the level of detail one sees when displaying totals for a rebate agreement.The manual accruals order type is actually a sales document type, which is assigned to the rebate agreement and is used in the manual accruals in a rebate agreement.\\nNote that the sales document type assigned here should have an order-relevant billing type assigned to it.\\nThe SAP standard uses the billing type B4 for the sales document type R4.\\nShould you wish to make manual payments of the rebate to the recipient, you may indicate this in the payment procedure.\\nWhen a manual payment is carried out, the system automatically creates a credit memo request of the type specified in the partial settlement field for the specified amounts.\\nThus, when the system carries out the final settlement, all partial payments are taken into account and the remaining balance is paid.',\n",

Account determination and assignment will be dealt with in detail in Chapter 8. There are no significant differences between standard account determination rules and assignments for standard condition types and rebates other than the following. Rebate condition types must have an account key assigned to them in the pricing procedure used by the sales document type for orders and billings. One account key is assigned for revenues and the opposite account key is assigned for accruals. These account keys are assigned individual general ledger accounts.

This means that it is possible to sell goods from a plant linked to a different company code than the company code to which the sales organization is linked. Inter-company Sales Transaction An inter-company sale transaction occurs when a sale occurs and the sales organization belongs to a different company code than that of the delivering plant. To create inter- company sales transactions, use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Billing | Inter-company Billing An inter-company sale may be described with the following example. The customer orders stock from the sales organization (for example 3001). The sales organization (3001) belongs to a company code, for example, 3000. The sales organization (3001) then creates the sales order and indicates the delivering plant as a plant that belongs to a different company code, for example, company code 1000.The sales organization (3001) then invoices the customer for materials purchased.\\nThe system automatically creates an inter-company billing document at the same time as the customer’s billing document is created.\\nThis inter-company invoice is sent from the delivering plant to the selling sales organization.This is defined as an inter-company sales transaction.\\nThe result of an inter-company sales transaction is that the system will create two billing documents.\\nThe first is the standard customer billing document that is sent from the sales organization to the customer who receives the goods.\\nThe second is the inter-company billing document that is sent from the delivering plant to the sales organization.\\n\\nInter-company Stock Transfer\\nWhen dealing with different company codes, you may find a need to transfer stock between company codes.\\nShould the stock be transferred within the same company code, there is no need for an inter-company transaction.\\nHowever, should the stock be transferred between different company codes, then there is a transference of value and cost and thus an inter- company sale.\\nFor example, company code 3000, which has plant 3000, creates a purchase order to purchase stock from plant 1000 based in company code 1000.\\nThe stock is then delivered to plant 3000.\\nCompany code 1000 then creates an inter-company invoice and bills company code 3000 for the stock.This process is defined as an inter-company stock transfer.\\n\\nDefining Order Types for Inter-company Sales Transaction Billing\\nTo define order types, use the following menu path.\\n',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Pricing and Taxes\\nThis chapter covers the condition technique in detail, as well as pricing structure.We look at formulas and routines as well as requirements.\\nWe implement tax determination and account assignment.\\n\\nThe Condition Technique\\nThe condition technique is the single largest configuration technique used in the Sales and Distribution module.\\nUnderstanding how the condition technique operates will allow you to understand how the system reacts in different scenarios.\\nThe condition technique is used in pricing, text determination, output determination, and material determination—basically anywhere you have a condition record.\\nThe condition technique is the technique that SAP uses to find a choice from among a number of alternatives.\\nSAP makes the choice based on conditions, hence the name “condition technique.”For example, let’s say SAP must find a price for a product, but a number of prices can exist for the product.\\nThere could be the list price that applies to that group of products, a special price for that customer, or a specific price for that product.What product is being sold, who it is being sold to, and the product group the product belongs to are all called conditions.\\nThey are specific situations that apply to that sale.\\nDifferent conditions (for example, different products) will have different prices.The different conditions and the prices associated with each are stored in SAP in condition records.So, for example, SAP can first look for a price for a customer and product.\\nIf one is not found, it can continue looking at the other conditions—for example, for a product price.\\nIf a price is still not found, it can look for a product group price.\\nThese condition records are all grouped in a condition table.\\nYou may have many tables; each table is accessed by the system in a specific sequence called an access sequence.An access sequence of condition tables is assigned to a condition type.\\nYou can therefore have condition types for prices (which contain, for example, the conditions customer and product price, product price, and product group price), discounts, and so on.Condition types are grouped together in a determination procedure.\\nA determination procedure is simply “a process to determine a value using the condition technique.”The result of the search is a value for the condition, or a condition value.These examples show the condition technique used in pricing, but you will see it is used in many other areas of SAP.\\nFor example, it is also used in account determination.\\nWhenever a transaction is posted to accounting, SAP must find (or determine) which account to post the revenues and discounts to.There is, therefore, a determination procedure to find the accounts, called the account determination procedure.\\nThis procedure contains a condition type to find which account to post to, based on the conditions of the sale.\\nThe condition type searches all the records that contain accounts for conditions that match the sale in the order of the access sequence.\\nAs soon as it finds a record that matches the conditions, it returns a condition value—in this case, the general ledger account.The condition technique is used because you may wish to post to different accounts under different conditions.\\nFor example, sales of a certain material can go to one revenue account and sales of other materials to a different account; or export sales can go to one account, local sales to another account.\\nDepending on all these conditions (the material, types of sale, etc.), SAP can find a different account.\\nThe condition technique is used to find the right account under the right conditions.\\n\\nThe Condition Technique as Used in Pricing\\nThe condition technique is the single largest configuration technique used in the Sales and Distribution module.\\nIt is used throughout the pricing section.\\n(Please refer to the thorough introduction to the condition technique in the beginning of Chapter 5.) In pricing a number of alternatives are available on which to base a price of a product.\\nThese alternatives are variable according to specific conditions at the time of the sale.\\nFor example, a customer wishes to purchase a product such as a television.\\nThis television has a standard sales price of $500.00 to all customers.\\nHowever should the customer be part of a large corporation, a different pricing structure is used, offering a lower sales price of $450.00.\\nThis is governed by the condition technique.The condition technique says if a pricing condition record such as “large corporate customers” is found for a particular customer, then he is offered the cheaper sales price.\\nHowever, if no condition record is found, proceed to the next condition, which is merely a standard material price.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Pricing and Taxes > The Condition Technique as Used in Pricing\\nWe know from previous introductions on the condition technique that a condition record that is the actual record found on the basis of specific values in fields is placed in a condition table.A condition table is a table of fields used to find that condition record, and it is placed into an access sequence.\\nAn access sequence is the sequential placing of condition tables in a logical order to obtain a condition record.An access sequence is assigned to a condition type, and this condition type is placed into a determination procedure such as the pricing procedure.In the simple example used earlier, we would have the following structure:• A standard pricing procedure—for example, RVAA01.• Inside this structure we would have a pricing condition type PR00 (standard price).• This condition type would use the access sequence PR00 (standard access sequence for pricing).The access sequence could have two steps and two condition tables in logical order from the most specific condition to the most general condition.\\nThus the first access could be sales organization plus distribution channel plus customer and material, which is the standard condition table 005.\\nAnd the second condition could be sales organization plus distribution channel and material, which uses the standard condition table 004.\\n(The exclusive indicator would be used to ensure no duplicate pricing is carried out. This will be covered later.) • At least two condition records could be created, one for each table.\\nOne condition record would be for the material only and one condition record would be for the material and customer.The purpose of this section is to investigate different uses and ensure optimal performance in the use of the condition technique in pricing.\\n\\nDefining Condition Types\\nTo define a condition type, use the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Pricing | Pricing Control | Define Condition Types | Maintain Condition Types [V/06]\\n | Condition types are used to define pricing elements such as prices, discounts, surcharges, or taxes.\\n | Should you wish to make any alteration to the condition type or assign a new access sequence to an existing condition type, copy the condition type that represents the nearest outcome you are after and change its key to begin with the letter Z. Then proceed to change the condition type to suit your needs. Following are a number of useful SAP standard condition types one may use to copy from:\\n | BO01 | Group Rebate | Expense reimbursement | Percentage\\n | --- | --- | --- | ---\\n | BO02 | Material Rebate | Expense reimbursement | Quantity dependent\\n | BO03 | Customer Rebate | Expense reimbursement | Percentage\\n | BO04 | Hierarchy Rebate | Expense reimbursement | Percentage\\n | HA00 | Percentage Discount | Discount or surcharge | Percentage\\n | HB00 | Discount (Value) | Discount or surcharge | Fixed amount\\n | K005 | Customer/Material | Discount or surcharge | Quantity dependent\\n | K007 | Customer Discount | Discount or surcharge | Percentage\\n | KF00 | Freight | Discount or surcharge | Gross weight dependent\\n | PR00 | Price | Prices | Quantity dependent\\n | R100 | 100% Discount | Discount or surcharge | Percentage\\n | RA00 | % Discount from Net | Discount or surcharge | Percentage\\n | RA01 | % Discount from Gross | Discount or surcharge | Percentage\\n | RB00 | Discount (Value) | Discount or surcharge | Fixed amount\\nOther condition types are always used, however, there is not often a need to copy and alter them.\\nCondition types that would fall into this category would be',\n",

The scale type field is left blank to indicate the scale is able to be set up in the condition record.On the Control Data 2 section of the condition type screen, the currency conversion field, if checked, will cause the system to convert the condition currency to the document currency after the multiplication of the items.\\nShould the value not be checked, the system converts the currency of the condition into the document currency before multiplying the value for the items.The accruals check box makes the value determined by this condition type statistical— for example, to be used in finance for accruals for rebates.\\nThe inter-company billing condition permits you to indicate that this condition type is used for internal costing.',\n",

Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic Functions | Pricing | Pricing Control | Define Access Sequences | Maintain Access Sequences [V/07] You will receive a dialog box warning you that the change you are about to make is cross-client. This means that any change you make will automatically be changed in all clients within your system. To understand what the difference is between a system and a client, it is simple. You often log onto a system ID in the SAP logon pad or the SAP logon list of systems. Naming conventions often use the first letter of an English system ID such as D for development, Q for quality, and P for production. (But as you can guess, this is a gross generalization). The client ID is normally a three-digit number that you change above where you enter your logon name and password. A client is inside one system. Therefore, a cross- client change means all clients within that system will be changed. Again, select the access sequence that closely resembles your required access sequence, and copy it.I find it easier to give the access sequence the same key identification as the condition type to promote ease of use in the system later.\\nThus, for condition type Z007 we will create an access sequence Z007.For the purpose of this example, we will create a new access sequence, Z007.\\nClick the New Entries button and enter in the name and description of the access sequence as shown in Figure 8-6.\\nAfter entering a description and pressing ENTER you will be asked if you wish to copy all sub-dependent entries.\\nSelect Yes.\\nyou can always go back and remove them later. | FIGURE 8-5 | New condition table\\n | FIGURE 8-6 | Creating an access sequence Select the access sequence and select the Accesses folder in the file structure on the left.\\nYou can remove the tables you don’t wish to use by selecting them and clicking the Delete button.\\n(Select Delete Dependent Entries too; this will remove the values in the field structure within the access sequence too.)

Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic Functions | Pricing | Pricing Control | Define and Assign Pricing Procedures | Maintain Pricing Procedures [V/08]There are some controls on the pricing procedure.\\nFor example, you can specify that a condition type is mandatory—it must have an entry either defined automatically or entered in manually.The pricing procedure is also used in account determination.\\nThis determines which GL accounts the prices, discounts, and taxes must be posted to.\\nThe condition types in the pricing procedure are linked to an account key.\\nThis key in turn is linked to the general ledger accounts.\\nThis shows the integration between the pricing in the invoice and the FI module.The SAP standard system includes various standard pricing procedures that may be used as a reference model for the pricing procedures you may wish to create.\\nIt is advisable when creating a pricing procedure to copy a standard such as RVAA01, and then change and delete entries as you require.For the purposes of this book we will create our own pricing procedure.\\nYou create a pricing procedure by selecting new entries and giving the pricing procedure a meaningful key and description.',\n",

The Stat column is used by the pricing procedure to add a value statistically.\\nThat is, the value represented for this step will not alter the overall value in the procedure.\\nThis may be used, for example, to represent the cost price of the material sold.\\nThe thin column following Stat, which is normally obscured, is labeled P for Print.\\nThis column may be made wider (as may all the other columns) by clicking the line separating the columns and dragging it.\\nThis print indicator is used to determine what descriptions and associated values assigned to a step are to be printed on a document—for example, order confirmation.',\n",

Start by clicking New Entries and enter the Price condition type PR00 as step 10.2. As this is the price of the item, it should be mandatory, so indicate the condition type as mandatory.3. As it is quite possible some items are not relevant for pricing, it is advisable to assign a requirement indicating this condition type is not necessary for items not relevant for pricing.\\nTo do this, assign the requirement 002 to the Rqt column.4. You may also assign the account key ERL to the ActKy column, in order to post these values to the revenue account.5. Should you not have any further values you wish to add to your gross price, you may add a second step 40 (allow yourself some space between steps at this early stage).6. On step 40 do not assign any further condition types, but in the description field you may specify the description “Gross value.”7. In all probability the customer will want to see this value printed on his documentation, so indicate S in the print column.8. The gross value may also be used later so assign the subtotal value 1 in the SubTo column.These initial steps in your pricing procedure would look like Figure 8-12.\\nWhen using a condition type using condition class B (prices), the system may only use one price per line item.\\nThus, should the system have a second price in the pricing procedure, it will invalidate all previous pricing conditions.FIGURE 8-12 Additions to pricing procedureFollowing with the pricing procedure, we may wish to add extra charges, as well as maybe deduct discounts from the value.\\nThe discounts we give to the customer should not be deducted from the gross value plus the extra charges.\\nRather the discounts offered by most companies are discounts from the gross value, with extra charges being added subsequently.\\nFor this reason we’ll now proceed in adding the discount condition types:1. Create a step 50 and assign the newly created discount condition type Z007.2. Create a step 60 and assign another discount condition type—for example, K005 (based on the customer and material).',\n",

It is possible you may have a negotiated discount between the sales person and the Sold-to Party at the time of creating the sales order.\\nFor this reason you may require a manual discount condition type, so allocate condition type RB00 to step 70.4. For all these three steps the customer would want to see the discount he is obtaining so indicate them relevant for printing in the P column.5. Again for all these three steps it is advisable to indicate to the system from what value it should offer the discount, so specify 40 in the Fro column.6. These condition types are only valid should the item in the sales order be relevant for pricing, so assign requirement 002 to the three new discounts.7. You may assign the general ledger account key ERS to each condition type.8. Do not forget that condition type RB00 is manual, so you should enable the manual indicator on the pricing procedure.9. Lastly, you may specify a “total discount” value in step 100 (again, allowing room for further changes in the step numbering).Your pricing procedure should now resemble Figure 8-13, also using the From and To values in step 100 to add the discounts.You may now decide the customer should be liable for additional charges such as freight costs:1. In step 110 add a condition type KF00 and in step 120 add HD00.\\nAs HD00 is a manual condition type, you should indicate this on the pricing procedure.2. The values represented by freight should be updated into subtotal field 4, so assign 004 to the SubTo column for both condition types.3. Both conditions should also be posted to the general ledger in a specific revenue account for freight, so assign the conditions the account key ERF.4. You may wish to now have a net value total, so assign the net value description to a new step 130.\\nThis net value should use the net value alternative calculation type 002 as well as subtotal 002.\\nIt should also be relevant for printing.Your pricing procedure will now resemble Figure 8-14.FIGURE 8-13 Further additions to the pricing procedureCopyright by SAP AGFIGURE 8-14 More steps added to the pricing procedure FIGURE 8-15 Completed pricing procedureYou can now assign the taxes relevant to be levied against the customer.\\nAs taxes and their maintenance vary from place to place, we will use condition type MWST to represent our taxes:1. Add condition type MWST to step 140.2. This condition type is mandatory so select the mandatory indicator.3. As the taxes are obtained on the basis of the delivering plant in order to obtain the country delivered from, it is advisable to use the requirement to check if the plant has been maintained in the sales order first, so assign the requirement 010 to step 140.4. The alternative condition base value used by the standard system for the MWST is 16.5. As the revenue for the tax must be posted to a separate general ledger account, the account key assigned is MWS.6. Now that the tax has been added to the net value, the item may now be totaled.\\nAssign a description Total to step 150 with the SubTo column indicating an A, which is the basis for the credit price.\\nThis means that the credit value will post to KOMP-CMPRE and the value will be reflected in the field CMPRE.\\nIf you look at the item table VBAP, CMPRE will now hold a value, which is determined by this setting.\\nOne may use these tables for reporting purposes, outputs, etc.\\nThe total value may also use the alternative calculation base value of 004, which is the net value plus the tax value.7. It is possible you will need to have your cost price represented in the pricing procedure.\\nFor this reason you may enter a step 160 and assign the VPRS condition type to this step.',\n",

The profit margin may now be added in line 170.\\nAdd “Profit margin” as the description.10.\\nAssign alternative calculation type 011 to this step, which takes the net value and deducts the cost price to determine the profit margin.Your pricing procedure should now look similar to Figure 8-15.\\nThe pricing procedure is now complete.\\nYou have configured enough of the procedure to adapt the different elements to match your business process.\\nDon’t forget the pricing procedure determination (covered later) must be carried out to ensure this created procedure is used in your sales document.\\nYou can check the customizing of your new procedure by running it in transaction code [VCHECKT683].The Pricing Type field seen in Figure 8-16 is used to default the type of pricing the system will use when the user selects Edit | New Pricing Document, as seen in Figure 8-17.\\nAlthough there is the ability to select the pricing type when you update pricing on the Conditions tab in the sales document, you may wish to restrict user access to this tab, and restrict the ability to update pricing manually in this way for all users.\\nInstead, you may\\n\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\n | FIGURE 8-16 | Pricing type assigned to pricing procedure\\n | FIGURE 8-17 | New pricing of sales document\\n\\nwish to use only the Edit | New Pricing menu path.\\nThe benefits of doing this are that as the user does not see sensitive pricing, he does not have the ability to remove the manual conditions, and cannot re-calculate pricing with a new pricing type that is not consistent with the business process.Do not forget the usage of the pricing type as used in copying rules and SAP Service Market Place OSS Note 24832, which outlines condition types that are re-determined according to the pricing type in copying.\\nFor example, pricing type G indicates “copy pricing elements unchanged and re-determine taxes.”\\nas discussed in the overview of condition types earlier in this chapter.For the same reason, if the condition type in pricing analysis says in a billing document “condition is found and set” and you are using the condition requirement number 024 (which only determines the price in billing document), and yet, you still have to do new pricing in order to obtain the condition record, the “fault” would be that the condition category on the condition type should be L. That way, when copying into a billing document, the requirement says “proceed with determining the value for the condition type” and the system does new pricing for that condition record due to the category being an L and thus finds a record.\\nShould the condition category be, for example, a blank, the system would propose the message “condition is found and set” but not provide an actual condition record.\\n\\nGeneral Pricing Procedure Notes\\nOther topics in SD have an impact on the pricing procedure, to ensure these are not overlooked I have listed a few of them here:\\n• Credit management The system uses the value as stored in the subtotal A. This will store the value in a special field called KOMP-CMPRE (item credit price).\\nEnsure subtotal A is assigned in the correct place in the pricing procedure, usually the “net value.”• Payment terms Generate a discount if the amount due is paid before a specific date.\\nThis is automatically used by the system, and requires the condition type SKTV to be in the pricing procedure.• Cost of sales The system automatically uses condition type VPRS as the condition to represent cost.',\n",

This grouping criteria allows the system an extra variable in determining the required account number. You can specify, as shown in Figure 8-44, whether a material should be classified as a product, service, or equipment. You may define as many account assignment groups as you require.\\n | To re-create new entries, you can copy the existing standard and rename the entry using a two-character alphanumeric key with a short description. After the creation of these account keys, you must ensure they are assigned to the material master record on the material sales org 2 tab, as shown in Figure 8-45.\\n | Customers: Account Assignment Groups\\n | To work with account assignment groups, use the following menu path.\\n | FIGURE 8-44 | Checking master data relevant for account assignment\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic\\n | Functions | Account Assignment/Costing | Revenue Account Determination | Check Master Data Relevant for Account Assignment | Customers: Account Assignment Groups Again, to re-create new entries, you can copy the existing standard and rename the entry using a two-character alphanumeric key with a short description. These account assignment keys are useful in grouping account determination. For example, the business may want domestic sales revenue to be posted into account X, while international sales revenue may have to be posted into account Y, differentiated by account assignment group.\\n | FIGURE 8-45 Materials: account assignment groups As account determination follows the condition technique, it is understandable there may be a need to change the condition table that is used in the access sequence to find the correct condition record (that is, the correct account number). This is possible by defining dependencies of revenue account determination. Defining Dependencies of Revenue Account Determination To define dependencies of revenue account determination, use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic Functions | Account Assignment/Costing | Revenue Account Determination | Define Dependencies of Revenue Account Determination Here you can create or change a condition table. However, you must be careful as there are not many fields to select from in order to create this condition table. Please refer back to pricing and condition tables in this chapter for more information on creating and changing condition tables.

       "  'chunk_text': 'Diverse Sales and Distribution Functions\\nThis chapter covers miscellaneous implementation topics that are crucial to SD but not large enough to warrant their own chapters, from sales incompletion logs, partner, text, and output determinations to hierarchies.\\n\\nSales Incompletion Logs\\nIt is imperative that specific control is maintained over the entering and failure to enter values in specific objects—for example, sales documents.\\nThe data maintained in the sales document is passed through to the delivery and finally the billing document.\\nThus it is the sales document data that is used as a backbone in sales and distribution processing.\\nIn some instances a delivery document may also need specific data to be maintained.\\nFor this reason SAP has an incompletion structure that may be maintained for the delivery to highlight missing data in sales as well as delivery documents, sales activities, and partner functions.\\n\\nDefining Status Groups\\nTo define the status groups, use the following menu path.\\n\\n\\nFunctions | Log of Incomplete Items | Define Status Groups\\nAn incompletion process inspects the object—for example, a sales document line item— and inspects specific fields in order to see if data has been maintained in these fields.\\nShould data not be maintained in these specified fields, the system is told how to respond—that is, does it or does it not give a warning message and to what extent does it allow further processing of the document (based upon the status group).\\nThe incompletion log cannot register what data is maintained in the specified field and compare it to data that should be in the specified field.\\nFor example, should a sales document header have a purchase order number, the system will only check to see if data is maintained in VBKD-BSTKD (sales document header - purchase order number).\\nThe standard system cannot check to see if the entry in the field is equal to, for example, 10002.\\nYou can create incompletion logs for the following:• Sales document header data• Sales document item data• Sales document schedule line data• Sales activity data• Partner data in sales documents, deliveries, and sales activities• Delivery header data• Delivery item dataIt may seem like we are configuring things in the wrong sequence, but we require a status group in order to assign it later, so first you need to define the status groups.\\nThis may be done by using the IMG path listed at the beginning of this section.\\nThese status groups are eventually assigned to the specific field in the incompletion procedure.\\nIt is possible to specify that in a sales document that field A may be incomplete but not hinder the document from being processed further, while field B may be incomplete and be the cause of the same document being blocked for further processing.The status groups, seen in Figure 9-1, will be assigned to a field in the sales incompletion log.\\nThis is where the control of the availability check is carried out.The statuses that may be incomplete are • General Setting this status in the status group and assigning the status group to a field in the incompletion procedure will cause the sales document to be incomplete.\\nHowever, it will allow the document to be processed further.• Delivery Setting this status in the status group and assigning the status group to a field in the incompletion procedure will cause the sales document to be incomplete for further processing, that is, the creation of a delivery (it will not hinder the creation of a billing document).• Billing document Setting this status in the status group and assigning the status group to a field in the incompletion procedure will cause the sales document and delivery document to be incomplete for further processing, that is, the creation of the billing document, should the associated field not be filled.• Price Setting this status in the status group and assigning the status group to a field in the incompletion procedure will cause the sales document to be incomplete for further processing should pricing not have been carried out.• Goods movement Setting this status in the status group and assigning the status group to a field in the incompletion procedure will cause the delivery document to be incomplete for further processing, that is, for goods movement, should a field not be filled (for example, quantity picked).',\n",

By selecting the Partner Functions folder in the file structure on the left side, we will see a list of permitted partner functions, as seen in Figure 9-11. Here you see the partner function ID in column 1, followed by its name in column 2. Each function is assigned a partner type, which groups and controls the partner function to behave in a specific manner. For example, the “Customer Hierarchy” is seen as a “customer partner type” value of KU. The value of 07 in the fourth column shows the incompletion number that is called should the customer master record not be assigned to the creation of the customer.

This is assigned to the partner function 1A, which is the highest node of partner represented in the hierarchy.\\nThere should not be a need for you to create more than one hierarchy type, as you may only assign one hierarchy type per sales document type, which we will see later.\\nThe only time you may need a new hierarchy type is when you use a different hierarchy for different business transactions.\\n',\n",

This hierarchy is broken down into specific levels, each level containing its own characteristics.\\n | FIGURE 9-43 Sales document with customer hierarchy A product hierarchy is recorded by the sequence of digits within a hierarchy number. This hierarchy number may have a maximum of 18 digits with a maximum of 9 levels. For example, a material may be classified as a laptop computer with a tablet screen, with the product hierarchy represented, with three levels, as follows: Computer 00001 Laptop 00002 Tablet screen 00000100 Thus, by assigning the hierarchy number 000010000200000100 to the material, one is able to determine a classification of the material. This hierarchy may be used in pricing, with each level being used as a field in the condition technique. Thus, it is possible to say all materials with a product hierarchy level 1 equal to 00001 may have a 10 percent discount. FIGURE 9-44 Selecting partner functions\\n | Each of these levels may also be used as fields for reporting purposes in the logistics information systems. It is possible for one to report on the number of computers sold by selecting all materials with level 1 equal to 00001. The SAP standard system has a product hierarchy structure consisting of three levels. These three levels are broken down into two levels of five digits each and one level of eight digits.\\n | Should this structure of hierarchy meet the requirements of your business, you can proceed straight through to the maintenance of the hierarchy in transaction code [V/76]. If, however, you need to create a new hierarchy structure, you can use the following guidelines.\\n | • One needs to maintain the product hierarchy structure PRODHS. (The maintenance of structures is not in the scope of this book; however, there is ample clear documentation in the system on how to perform this step.) This structure defines each level and the length of digits permitted for each level, as shown in Figure 9-45.\\n | FIGURE 9-45 | Product hierarchy structure PRODHS • You may proceed to create a template that represents the product hierarchy.\\nThis template should have placeholders as defined by an underscore (_) and separators as defined by a forward slash (/) or a colon (:). Thus a template of 5 and 5 and 8 digits may look as follows: //\\n• You can then create the product hierarchy as used by the system, for example in Figure 9-46.• Now that the hierarchy is created in the system as well as the template with the entries as allowed in the hierarchy, you merely need to ensure the hierarchy levels are in the field catalog as used in pricing, as seen in Figure 9-47.FIGURE 9-46 Creating a product hierarchy • The hierarchy levels must also be available in the field catalog as used in the Logistics information system. (LIS.)• Lastly, you must ensure the material master record has the product hierarchy assigned to it in the Basic Data 1 tab under General Data, as in Figure 9-48.This concludes our section on product hierarchy.\\nNote that in some companies the product hierarchy is a critical field, and used in a number of BW and LIS reporting structures, as well as in pricing.\\nDue to its sensitivity, it is advisable to fully investigate changes to its structure before making modifications.\\nIt is not as easily changed as adding a new value to a drop-down selection list. | FIGURE 9-47 | Product hierarchy ﬁelds in ﬁeld catalog\\n | FIGURE 9-48 | Product hierarchy on material master Basic Data 1 tab\\n',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Credit Management, Receivable Risk Management, Blocks, and Calendars\\nThis chapter contains details related to the financial control of customer accounts.This control is implemented in all parts of the order management and logistics cycles.\\n\\nCredit Management\\nCustomers have a time period in which to pay their accounts with the company.\\nThese time periods are defined in the payment terms that are assigned to the customer master record.\\nShould a customer not pay his outstanding amounts by the end of his allowed payment term, he is defaulting on his agreement and the company will need to govern his allowed credit more closely.In order to manage these situations SAP has developed a complex credit management solution that allows, among other things, the maintenance of credit limits per customer, as well the maintenance of the system responses should the customer’s credit limit be exceeded.\\nBefore we proceed with credit management, we need to discuss credit management master data.\\nFor example, a credit limit may be a customer credit limit, which may be configured as the permitted limit of the value of open items (invoices not yet paid plus the value of open sales orders plus the value of deliveries that have not been invoiced).The customer’s credit limit is assigned to the customer by Finance using the following menu path.\\n\\nManagement | Master Data | [FD32] - Change\\nNaturally a customer master record must exist before a credit limit may be applied to it.\\nA credit control area is an organizational unit in which the customer credit limits are managed in SAP.\\nYou can assign one or more company codes to a credit control area.\\nWhenever a sale takes place, SAP determines the company code from the sales organization, and using the company code, SAP determines the credit control area.\\nUsing the credit control area, SAP knows which credit management rules apply to the sale, and what credit limit the customer has for the sale.\\nBy assigning one company code to a credit control area, you can give the customers separate credit limits per company code.\\nIf you assign more than one company code to a credit control area, the customer has a single credit limit that applies across all sales in these company codes.In this way, you can centralize the credit management in your organization across all the company codes.\\nFor example, if a customer has used up his limit buying from one company code, he won’t be able to buy from any of the other company codes.\\nAlso, by centralizing the credit limit in this way, you don’t have to split up the total credit risk of the customer across company codes.\\nFor example, if you want your total exposure to the customer to be $1 million, but you have four company codes, how do you apportion that risk across each company code?\\nIf you create one credit control area, you can have one credit limit of $1 million that applies across all four companies.\\nYou won’t get a case where the customer has used up his credit at company A, but has available credit at company B, and now he wants to buy from company A using his limit at company B.These credit control areas are maintained and assigned in the enterprise structure.\\nA customer’s risk category is a grouping category that controls how the credit check is carried out when automatic credit control takes place.\\nFor example, you can define high-risk customers to risk category A01, medium-risk customers to B01, and low-risk customers to group C01.\\nYou can determine different credit control rules to apply in each case.\\nSo even though the customers belong to the same credit control area, you can have stricter rules for the high-risk customers.\\nWe will use this category and define its assignment later.\\n\\nMaintaining a Credit Control Area\\nTo create a credit control area, as shown in Figure 10-1, use the following menu path.\\n\\n\\nFinancial Accounting | Define Credit Control Area\\nWhat we see from these settings is that the currency key in the credit control area is EUR (Euros).\\nThe update rule, which is discussed in detail later, is 000012.\\nThe fiscal year variant for determining the posting date for credit management is set as key K4.\\nYou are required to have a fiscal year variant if the credit control area is assigned to more than one company code and each company code has a different fiscal year.\\nOther settings are configured as follows:\\n',\n",

Assigning Company Codes to a Credit Control Area To assign company codes, as shown in Figure 10-2, use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Assignment | Financial Accounting | Assign Company Code to Credit Control Area It is possible to assign a credit control area to a sales area (combination of sales organization, distribution channel, and division.) This is a more specific assignment than the assignment to the company code. Use the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Assignment | Sales and Distribution | Assign Sales Area to Credit Control Area You can also assign the credit control area directly in the customer master or in a user exit based on the sales order header fields (see EXIT_SAPFV45K_001).For customers, you assign the credit control area in the sales area data billing screen of the customer master.\\nNote that this field may be suppressed based on the customer account group field selection status—it is usually only active for the payer account group (0003).\\nIf you want to use this option, you may need to change the field selection to make this field an optional or mandatory field on the billing screen of the customer master.FIGURE 10-2 Assigning a company code to a credit control areaNote that even if you assign the credit control area based on the sales area, customer master, or user exit, you must still assign the company code to the credit control area by selecting Enterprise Structure | Assignment | Financial Accounting.\\n\\nCredit Control Basics\\nThere are only three places where a credit check can occur—the sales order, the delivery, and at goods issue.\\nThe system executes the credit check on the sales order or delivery based on the configuration settings.\\nIf the credit check fails, the system then either stops the user from saving the document, or it allows the document to be saved but it blocks the document with a credit block.Documents blocked for credit must be released by an authorized person before they can be processed further.\\nFor example, a delivery for an order cannot be created if the order has a credit block on it.You can view documents blocked for credit by selecting Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Credit Management | Sales and Distribution Documents | All (transaction code VKM3).\\nYou can also use this transaction to release a blocked document.Once a document is released, you can continue processing it even though the credit limit check failed.Every time a user changes a sales document, the credit limit check is executed again.\\nFor example, if a document was released with a value of $10,000, and the value is changed to $11,000 and the customer is still over his limit, the document will be blocked for credit again.\\nThis is because the new value exceeds the released value.You can use program RVKRED08 to recheck all documents blocked for credit.\\nFor example, if a customer pays his account, you want to recheck all his documents.\\nSome documents can now be released because of the payment received.\\nIt is a good idea to schedule a background job using this program so that blocked documents are checked on a regular basis.\\nThis will keep the blocked documents up to date with any changes to the account or to sales documents, such as a payment being made.\\nIf a large sales order that was holding up the credit limit is cancelled, other blocked documents can use the value that is freed up by the cancellation.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Credit Management, Receivable Risk Management, Blocks, and Calendars > Credit Management > Credit Control Basics\\nThe system can use many different automatic credit management checks, which are discussed in detail later.\\nThese are • A static check • A dynamic check • A check on the total document value • A critical field check • A next review date check • A check on open items • A check on oldest open item • A check on highest permitted dunning levelNormally, one or more of these checks are carried out at the same time.\\nThere are three main credit control methods—namely, a simple credit check, a static credit check, or a dynamic credit check.\\n\\nThe Simple Credit Check\\nFirst, please note that this credit check is deemed obsolete and is not recommended to be used.\\nIt is only documented here for you to understand the differences if you come across a system with this installed, and is a good introduction into automatic credit control.\\nThe simple credit check compares the payer customer master record’s credit limit to the net document value plus the value of all open items.\\nShould the value of the document and open items be greater than the credit limit permitted, the system may respond with a warning message in the sales order; a warning message and a delivery block, which will allow the order to be taken but will block it for delivery; or an error message, which will cause the document not to be saved.This setting for a simple credit check is set at the document type level, thus the system will use this simple check for all sales orders created for this particular sales document type.\\nThe system will perform the simple credit check for all created and changed sales documents.To define the simple credit check, use the following menu path.\\n\\nFunctions | Credit Management/Risk Management | Simple Credit Limit Check\\nYou can now assign the credit limit check to the sales document type, using the following codes:\\n | A | Run simple credit limit check and warning message\\n | B | Run simple credit limit check and error message\\n | C | Run simple credit limit check and delivery block\\nAs it is generally not beneficial to treat all customers the same way as far as credit management is concerned, SAP allows a dynamic and static credit check according to a customers risk category.This way you can determine that should a good customer with a low-risk credit rating exceed his credit limit, the sales order may still be created and not blocked, but should a high-risk customer with a high-risk credit rating exceed his credit limit using the same sales document type, the system may block the sales document from being processed further.\\nThis credit management control is maintained by using the automatic credit management functionality.\\n\\nAutomatic Credit Management\\nAutomatic credit management is used to carry out the different credit checks including the static and dynamic checks.\\nThis is done by separating the sales document types, the delivery document types, and goods issue into specific credit groups.\\nIt also uses the customer’s credit risk category as assigned to the customer master record of the payer (transaction code [FD32]) and assigns an outcome procedure to the combination of the credit group and the customer risk category along with the credit control area.\\n\\nDefining Customer Risk Category\\nThe definition of the customer’s risk category is carried out in the Financial Accounting module, so use the following menu path.\\n | Menu Path | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Financial Accounting | Accounts\\n | Receivable and Accounts Payable | Credit Management | Credit Control Account | Define Risk Categories It is advisable to be as simplistic as possible when defining the credit risk categories and document credit groups. Due to the number of combinations you can perform with these two groupings, if you define a large number, you will have a large number of credit management strategies to configure. For example, if you have 10 risk categories and 4 document credit groups, you have 40 credit management strategies to configure. I find the following credit groups are normally required: New, High, Medium, Low, and No risk. The risk categories may be seen in Figure 10-3. Now that the risk category has been defined, it is necessary to define the credit groups.\\n | Defining Credit Groups\\n | Credit groups are configured in Sales and Distribution as opposed to Financial Accounting.

The static credit limit check is a check comparing the credit limit assigned to the customer to the total value of open sales orders, plus the total value of open deliveries not yet invoiced, plus the total value of open billing documents not yet passed on to accounting, plus the total value of billing documents that have been passed on to accounting but that have not yet been paid by the customer.\\nThe dynamic credit check is a check comparing the customer’s credit limit to the total of open sales orders not yet delivered, plus the total value of open deliveries not yet invoiced, plus the total value of open billing documents not yet passed on to accounting, plus the total value of billing documents that have been passed on to accounting but that have not yet been paid by the customer.This dynamic check has an attached time period (called the credit horizon) that states that the system is not to include sales orders in the total of outstanding items that are due for delivery outside the credit horizon.For example, the time period may be two months, so when the system defines the credit amount used by a customer it includes all open items in sales orders due for delivery from now to two months into the future.\\nIt does not include open items whose shipping date is more than two months in advance.These are the two main types of checks you can maintain.\\nHowever, you may also require additional checks to be performed, either in combination with the dynamic or static credit checks or on their own.\\nThese additional checks are • Credit check when the maximum document value is exceeded This check is performed when a document value in the currency of the credit control area is exceeded—for example, the company may wish all sales orders exceeding a value of $10,000 USD to be automatically blocked and released by a credit manager.• Credit check when changing critical fields It is possible to institute a recheck of the credit, should certain customer master record fields that are credit relevant be altered in the sales order from those proposed from the master record—for example, the customer’s payment terms.• Credit check at the time of the next internal check This activates the credit check to be performed on all documents after the date of the next internal credit check.\\nThis date is defined in the credit management master data (transaction code [FD32])—see the next internal review field.• Credit check on the basis of overdue open items This credit check is based upon the ratio of open items that are overdue by a certain number of days to the customer’s balance, which must not exceed a certain percentage.• Credit check on the basis of oldest open items This check allows the oldest open item to be only a certain number of days overdue.• Credit check against the maximum allowed dunning levels This check allows the dunning level of the customer to only reach a specific value.',\n",

       "  'chunk_text': 'Advanced Consultant Tools\\nAlthough these topics are supplementary to mainstream everyday Sales and Distribution use, they will enable you to understand the technical integration of the SD module within SAP.\\nHere we deal with user exits, enhancements, and data exchanges between systems.\\n\\nSales and Distribution User Exits, Enhancements and BADis\\nIn SAP there are empty ABAP forms at particular points in the standard SAP program code where SAP allows customers to make enhancements to the way the code functions.\\nThese empty modules, called user exits, can be filled with customer-specific program code.\\nFor example, SAP provides an empty form where the customer can write his own code to determine the number for a sales document.\\nThis user exit is called after the SAP standard code to get the document number from the configurable number ranges.\\nSo you can overwrite the number determined by SAP using your own code.SAP will continue to support the existing user exits in the system, but they have made a design decision not to create any new user exits.\\nThe reason is that the user exit is “unsafe” in the sense that the person writing the code has access to all the global data in the program and can make changes unrelated to what the user exit was designed for.\\nFor example, in the code to determine the customer’s own number for a sales document, the programmer can change/delete one or more of the items in the sales order.SAP has replaced the user exit concept with the SAP enhancement concept.\\nIn an SAP enhancement, SAP provides a function module call in the same place as they would have put a user exit.\\nThe import parameters of the function module provide the data you can use and the export parameters provide the data you can change.\\nSo you are limited in the program code of the function module—you can only see the import parameters and you can only change the export parameters.\\nThere is no ability to change the global data of the calling program, or interfere in the standard code in a way the enhancement is not defined.\\n\\nSAP Enhancements\\nPlease note this is not a guide on how to implement a SAP enhancement but merely an introduction to the topic.\\nFIGURE 11-1 SAP enhancements The transaction code [SMOD] may be used to view all the enhancements in the system. An enhancement may consist of one or more function modules. Some enhancements allow you to change the SAP screen. In these cases, the enhancement will contain subscreens, which are areas on the SAP screen that you are allowed to change. You may access the enhancement by the following menu path. Menu Path SAP Menu | Tools | ABAP Workbench | Utilities | Enhancements | [SMOD] - Definition You can see an example in Figure 11-1. When you want to use an SAP enhancement, you have to create a project in transaction code [CMOD]. Once you have created the project, you assign the SAP enhancement to the project. You can then create the include in the function module (or function modules if there is more than one that is part of the enhancement). Once you have finished programming the function module, you must activate the enhancement in order for SAP to call the function module from the standard code. Business Add-Ins Please note this is not a guide on how to implement a business add-in, but merely an introduction to the topic. As of SAP R/3 4.6A, SAP provides a new enhancement technique called business add- ins, also known as BADis. Business add-ins are generalized business transaction events that can be used to bundle program, menu, and screen enhancements into a single add-in. FIGURE 11-2 Business add-in deﬁnitionBADis are not restricted to a two-tiered infrastructure (i.e., where SAP provides the enhancement and the customer can code the enhancement).\\nBADis can be implemented on a multi-tiered infrastructure.\\nFor example, SAP can provide the enhancement and a third-party software vendor may provide the code for the BADi.\\nLike enhancements, BADis are guaranteed to be upwards compatible.\\nUpgrades do not affect enhancements or business add-in calls.Business add-ins are defined in the following menu path.Menu Path SAP Menu | Tools | ABAP Workbench | Utilities | Business Add-Ins | [SE18] -',\n",

Under Data Source, you may use a logical database, which is a standard database of tables that are logically structured per application. For a list of tables within the logical databases, refer to www.sapww.com. Select Table Join as seen in Figure 11-6. You will now see a blank page with the navigation pane at the bottom of the screen.

(In our example we have used KNA1, KNB1, and KNVV). You will have a screen similar to Figure 11-7.\\n | SAP will automatically provide suggestions for the table links/conditions. We can see between KNA1 and KNB1 SAP has linked KNA1-KUNNR with KNB1-EKVBD. This is not a good suggestion.

some cases to designate these documents as relevant for retroactive billing.\\nYou do this by entering the relevant order reason in the billing document.Examples of order reasons include price changes, poor quality or ruined material.\\nDepending on how the order reason you entered is customized, this billing document becomes relevant for retroactive billing.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\nTo make the credit and debit memos and memo requests relevant for retroactive billing, you need to assign a type to the order reason as follows:\\n• for primary documents, assign type 2\\n• for secondary documents, assign type 1\\n• for documents which are not relevant for retroactive billing, do not assign a type\\nYou assign types to order reasons in Customizing for Sales and Distribution (choose Sales → Sales Documents → Sales Document Header → Define order reasons).\\n\\nFeatures\\nWhen you enter an order reason which has been assigned a type in Customizing, the billing document becomes relevant for retroactive billing as follows:\\n• Primary Document (order reason is assigned type 2)\\nIf you enter an order reason with type 2 in a credit or debit memo or memo request, the system will use this billing document in retroactive billing as a primary document.The system will then calculate the retroactive billing amount for this billing document just as for a standard invoice.\"Poor quality\" would be a typical order reason for this type, for example.Order Reason in Retroactive Billing\\n\\n10 pieces @ $10 / piece\\n$100 $30 (3 pieces poor quality) $9 / piece

this example, the customer was sent an invoice with a net value of $100.\\nBecause 3 pieces were of poor quality, the customer received a credit of $30.This credit memo (no. 601) would normally not be included in the retroactive billing list.\\nHowever, the order reason poor quality has been assigned type 2 in Customizing, which means that the credit memo is a primary document relevant for retroactive billing.\\nTherefore, the system calculates the difference between the net value ($30) and today\\\\\\'s net value ($27) and creates a debit memo of $3 on the basis of the credit memo no.

basis of the invoice.The credit and debit memos created by the system both have the order reason price too high, which has been assigned type 1 in Customizing.\\nShould there be a subsequent retroactive billing run, these billing documents will be relevant for retroactive billing as secondary documents.\\n\\nOrder Reason in Retroactive Billing\\n• Secondary Document (order reason is assigned type 1)\\nIf you enter an order reason with type 1 in a credit or debit memo or memo request, the system will use this billing document in retroactive billing as a secondary document.\"Price

25\\n | 2nd Price change date: (Price effective: | September 1 February 1)\\n | 10 pieces @ $10 / piece\\n | $100\\n | $30 (3 pieces poor quality)\\n | $8.50 / piece\\n | Retro-Billing as at September

the order reason price too high, which has been assigned type 1 in Customizing.\\nTherefore, they in turn, become relevant for retroactive billing, but as secondary documents.\\n\\nCurrent net

and subtracts the net value of the secondary document, credit memo 602 ($10) and creates credit memo no. 604 ($5) on the basis of the invoice.\\nThe system carries out the same procedure for credit memo no. 601.\\nIt calculates the difference between the net value of the credit memo ($30) and today\\\\\\'s net value ($25.50).\\nIt then takes this difference ($4.50) and subtracts the net value of the secondary document, debit memo no. 603 ($3) and creates credit memo no. 605 ($1.50) on the basis of credit memo no. 601.• Documents with Other Order ReasonsAlthough the system does not take

      "Use\n",
      "New pricing agreements that you make with your customers may affect billing documents that have already been processed and settled.\n",
      "If a new pricing agreement is effective before the pricing date of the billing documents, you can perform retroactive billing to call up a list of these documents and reevaluate them with the new price.\n",
      "You can then create additional billing documents to settle any differences.\n",
      "Integration\n",
      "Retroactive billing is a special billing function often used in scheduling agreement processing [Ext.\n",
      "].\n",
      "Features\n",
      "With the retroactive billing function, you can:\n",
      "• Call up a list of documents affected by price changes\n",
      "• Trigger the system to create the necessary retroactive billing documents directly from the list\n",
      "• Create credit or debit memos directly\n",
      "• Review any errors in a log\n",
      "• Simulate the retroactive billing process for any document\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Retroactive Billing work?\n",
      "The following graphic shows a simple example of retroactive billing:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "F1: Invoice\n",
      " | 4711 Total net value = $100 | 10 pc @ $10\n",
      " | G2: Credit Memo\n",
      " | 4711 Difference = $10 | 10 pc @ $1Retroactive\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "New price = $9 / piece New Total net value = $90\n",
      "In this example, the system calculates the difference between the net value of the invoice ($100) and today\\'s net value based on the new price ($90).\n",
      "It then creates a credit memo with the net value of $10 to be credited to the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary and Secondary Documents\n",
      "The system calculates retroactive billing values for primary documents.\n",
      "It can use secondary documents to help calculate this value.\n",
      "Invoices are always primary documents.Other billing documents, such as debit or credit memos, can be primary or secondary documents.\n",
      "This depends on the order reason entered in the billing document.For more information on how the order reason is used to control primary and secondary documents, see Order Reason in Retroactive Billing [Page 8].\n",
      "This section will also provide a more detailed example of how retroactive billing works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary Documents\n",
      "Primary documents are:\n",
      "• Invoices\n",
      "• Credit memos that refer to returns\n",
      "• Credit and debit memos in which you have entered the relevant order reason\n",
      "You can also assign an order reason to a memo request which then passes it along to the referenced credit or debit memo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary Documents\n",
      "Secondary documents are the following billing documents in which you have entered the relevant order reason:\n",
      "• Credit and debit memo requests\n",
      "• Credit and debit memos\n",
      "The system displays such a document only when it has been created with reference to the invoice and when the currencies in both documents match.If you create a credit or debit memo (or memo request) without reference to an invoice, you will not be able to see in the retroactive billing list if the invoice has already been billed retroactively.When you create a credit or debit memo request which is relevant for retroactive billing as a secondary document, the system will use it to calculate retroactive billing for the referenced document.The system does not take into account whether or not a request has been rejected, partially billed, or billed using another pricing procedure.\n",
      "Also, it does not take into account any changes in the payer, sold-to party, sales organization, billing date, or material.\n",
      "Order Reason in Retroactive Billing > Use\n",
      "Credit and debit memos and memo requests are not included in the retroactive billing list.\n",
      "However, you may find it necessary in some cases to designate these documents as relevant for retroactive billing.\n",
      "You do this by entering the relevant order reason in the billing document.Examples of order reasons include price changes, poor quality or ruined material.\n",
      "Depending on how the order reason you entered is customized, this billing document becomes relevant for retroactive billing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prerequisites\n",
      "To make the credit and debit memos and memo requests relevant for retroactive billing, you need to assign a type to the order reason as follows:\n",
      "• for primary documents, assign type 2\n",
      "• for secondary documents, assign type 1\n",
      "• for documents which are not relevant for retroactive billing, do not assign a type\n",
      "You assign types to order reasons in Customizing for Sales and Distribution (choose Sales → Sales Documents → Sales Document Header → Define order reasons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "When you enter an order reason which has been assigned a type in Customizing, the billing document becomes relevant for retroactive billing as follows:\n",
      "• Primary Document (order reason is assigned type 2)\n",
      "If you enter an order reason with type 2 in a credit or debit memo or memo request, the system will use this billing document in retroactive billing as a primary document.The system will then calculate the retroactive billing amount for this billing document just as for a standard invoice.\"Poor quality\" would be a typical order reason for this type, for example.Order Reason in Retroactive Billing\n",

       " Document(page_content='The procurement department must ensure that the production and purchasing departments are advised of inadequate stock quantities so that goods can either be produced punctually or ordered. Sales transfers the information on materials ordered as requirements to material requirements planning. Requirements are planned outward movements of stock. The transfer of requirements informs production that goods must be produced, or advises purchasing that purchase requisitions have been created for which purchase orders must be created and sent to the suppliers.

Among other things, these factors also determine the scope of the check. The scope of the check can be defined differently in the sales documents and in the deliveries. You can also specify whether the availability check takes replenishment lead time into account. For further information on working with the availability check, see\\n\\nTypes of Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 9]\\n\\nControlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 13]\\n\\nTiming of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 17]\\n\\nScope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 18]\\n\\nReactions to the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 20]\\n\\nFor further information on the availability check, see\\n\\nAvailability Check in Shipping [Page 49]\\n\\n8\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nTypes of Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nTypes of Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing There are three types of availability check:\\n\\nCheck on the basis of the ATP quantities\\n\\nCheck against product allocation\\n\\nCheck against planning\\n\\nIn Customizing, you determine whether an availability check is to be carried out against the ATP quanitity or against planning. The check against product allocations is controlled in the material master and elsewhere in the system. Check on the Basis of the ATP Quantities\\n\\nThe ATP quantity (ATP = Available To Promise) is calculated from the warehouse stock, the planned inward movements of stock (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders) and the planned outward movements of stock (sales orders, deliveries, reservations). This type of check is performed dynamically for each transaction, taking into account the relevant stock and planned goods movements with or without replenishment lead time.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Planned independent requirements are not taken into account here. Check against Product Allocation\\n\\nProduct allocation facilitates period-based distribution of products for certain customers or regions. As of Release 3.0F, you can carry out an availability check against product allocation. This ensures, for example, that when production is low, the first customer does not get the full amount, resulting in following sales orders not being confirmed or being confirmed far too late. Check against planning\\n\\nThe check against planning is performed against independent requirements which are usually created for an ‘anonymous’ market rather than being customer-specific (for example, in the strategy ‘Planning without assembly’, when production occurs only up to the stocking level). The planned independent requirements result from demand program planning and are used for planning expected sales quantities independent of orders\\n\\nWeitere Informationen hierzu erhalten Sie unter Allocating and Reducing Independent Requirements in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 45]. Including Replenishment Lead Time\\n\\nReplenishment lead time is the time that is needed to order or produce the requested material. The system determines replenishment lead time according to specific times defined by you in the material master record. Depending on the material type, replenishment lead time can be calculated according to various time periods. In the case of trading goods, for example, it is determined according to the planned delivery time, purchasing processing time, and the goods receipt processing time. Replenishment lead time is only included in the check performed on the basis of the ATP quantity. December 1999\\n\\n9\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nTypes of Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nAvailability Check Including Replenishment Time\\n\\nAvailability is only checked up to the end of replenishment lead time. If the material availability date is calculated on the basis of the current date to lie after the replenishment lead time for the item, the item itself can be confirmed despite insufficient stock being available. In this case, the system assumes that any quantity requested by the customer can be procured by the material availability date and considers the goods to be available. Therefore, a binding confirmation can be sent to the customer. The following figure shows such a case.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The customer wants 20 pieces delivered in full by the requested delivery date. Using backward scheduling, the system determines a material availability date. However, no goods are available. The inward movement of 100 pieces is used up by an outward stock movement. Therefore no stock is available for the material availability date determined by the system. If replenishment lead time were not taken into account, the following situation would arise. The customer wants complete delivery. However, as a result of further inward (50 pieces) and outward stock movements (40 pieces), the goods only become available shortly before the requested delivery date specified by the customer when 60 pieces are added to the stock. Correspondingly, the delivery date resulting from this material availability date would lie further in the future. However, since replenishment lead time is taken into account during the availability check, the 20 pieces ordered can be delivered before this date, namely at the end of the replenishment lead time.

For in-house produced goods, the overall replenishment lead time is required, for externally procured materials, the planned delivery time, the processing time for goods receipt, or the processing time for purchasing is required. 10\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nTypes of Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nPerforming the availability check including replenishment lead time only makes sense if materials planning is carried out at regular intervals (best of all, daily for individual and daily requirements and weekly for weekly requirements). This ensures that inward movements of goods are checked against confirmed quantities. This is necessary as the delivery date for a sales order which has been confirmed on the day before replenishment lead time begins lies the next day within the replenishment lead time period and this leads to insufficient stock being available. This shortage can result in problems such as delivery creation being blocked. Availability Check Excluding Replenishment Lead Time\\n\\nIf replenishment lead time is not to be taken into account in the availability check, the system can perform an unrestricted availability check. The following figure shows how the system reacts if an availability check is performed under the same conditions as in the figure above but excluding replenishment lead time. The customer also requires complete delivery of 20 pieces in this example.

In this case, this is on the date when 60 pieces are added to stock. Availability Status Display Options\\n\\nYou have the following options for displaying availability for materials:\\n\\n1. In the sales menu you select Environment →=Availability Ovw to display the availability status for a material with reference to the plant and the checking rule.

General Control Features\\n\\nThe following control elements need to be maintained in Customizing and in the material master record:\\n\\nStrategy group\\n\\nThe allowed planning strategies (main strategy and further possible strategies) are combined in the strategy group. As of Release 3.0, the strategy group is specified in the material master record in the MRP 1 Screen. In Customizing, strategy groups are assigned, dependent on plant, to MRP groups. If the strategy group is missing in the material master record, it is determined on the basis of the MRP group, if it has been maintained. Up to Release 3.0, the strategy group is determined on the basis of the MRP group\\n\\nMRP group\\n\\nThe MRP group combines materials from the point of view of material requirements planning. This enables you to control planning for these materials in a particular way using, for example, the strategy group, consumption mode and planning period. You enter the MRP group in the material master in the MRP 1 screen. The strategy group is determined from the MRP group. Planning Strategy\\n\\nThe planning strategy specifies the requirements type for planning and customer requirements. This represents the decisive control feature for the interaction between Production Planning and Sales and Distribution. MRP type and item category\\n\\nIf no requirements type is found using the planning strategy, the system tries to determine a corresponding requirements type on the basis of the MRP type and the item category. Until 3.0C, determination of the requirements type via planning strategy has taken priority. This is not always the best option, however, as the following example will show. A requirements type is determined for a material, which causes availability to be checked against planning. In consignment stock processing, however, availability should be checked against stock. Until 3.0C the availability check had to be deactivated in these cases. As of Release 3.0C, you can determine how the requirements type is to be determined for each transaction by maintaining the Source field in Determination of requirement types using transaction in Customizing. Requirements type\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n13\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nControlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nThe various requirements are identified by their requirements type. The requirements type refers to the requirements class and its control features. Requirements Class\\n\\nThe requirements class contains all control features for planning such as relevance for planning, requirements planning strategy and requirements consumption strategy. In addition, it is specified at a global level whether an availability check is to take place for the material in the sales and distribution documents on the basis of the ATP quantity (ATP = available to promise) and whether requirements are to be passed on. A finer degree of control can be obtained for sales documents using the schedule line category. Control Features Specific to Sales and Distribution\\n\\nThe following SD-specific control features need to be maintained in Customizing:\\n\\nChecking group\\n\\nThe checking group controls whether the system is to create indivdual or collective requirements in sales and shipping processing. In addition, a material block for the availability check with transfer of requirements can be set here.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The checking group can also be used to deactivate the availability check. This option was created especially for the assembly order so that when the bill of material is exploded in the assembly order, the individual components, if necessary, can be classified as non-critical parts as far as procurement is concerned. The checking group specifies in combination with the checking rule the scope of the availability check. It is proposed in the material master record on the basis of the material type and the plant, and copied into the sales and distribution documents. Checking Rule\\n\\nYou use the checking rule to control the scope of the availability check for each transaction in sales and distribution. You also specify whether the check should be carried out including or excluding replenishment lead time. The individual checking rules define by transaction, which stock and inward and outward movement of goods should be taken into account for the availability check. Schedule line category\\n\\nYou can control with the schedule line category whether an availability check and transfer of requirements should be carried out in the sales documents. The possible settings for this at schedule line level are dependent on the settings in the requirements class which is determined from the requirements type of the material. Delivery item category\\n\\nThe delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes place in deliveries. Prerequisites\\n\\nAn availability check can only be carried out if the following prerequisites have been fulfilled:\\n\\nThe control elements described above for the availability check must be maintained in Customizing for Sales and the relevant assignments made to the sales transactions\\n\\nThe availability check must be switched on at requirements class level and - for the availability check in the sales documents - at schedule line category level\\n\\n14\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nControlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nA requirements type must exist by which the requirements class can be found\\n\\nA plant must be defined. It can either be proposed from the customer or material master record or can be entered manually in the document. A checking group must be defined in the material master record on the Sales/plant data screen in the Availability check field\\n\\nGlobal and Fine Control in Customizing\\n\\nAt the global requirements class level, the availability check can only be switched on in combination with the transfer of requirements. At schedule line level, the settings are proposed from the requirements class. If the availability check is switched on at requirements class level, it can be switched off at schedule line level. However, you cannot switch on the availability check at schedule line level, if it is switched off at requirements class level. You can make this setting at schedule line level. But the system ignores it and the setting for the requirements class applies. Also, at schedule line level when the availability check is switched on, the transfer of requirements can be switched off. For example, this makes sense for inquiries or sales information. The settings specific to schedule lines for performing an availability check are only relevant for sales documents. In the shipping documents, the settings from the requirements class and the delivery item category are used. As with the schedule line category, the availability check can be switched off as required in the delivery item category. Blocking Logic\\n\\nThere are two blocking concepts:\\n\\nMaterial block\\n\\nIn Customizing, the Define material block for other users, step is used to determine, by checking group and transaction (order/delivery), whether a material master record should be blocked for other users during an availability check. The block is set at material-plant level and remains in place until you save the sales document. Material block with quantity transfer\\n\\nFor performance-related reasons, the only time when it makes sense to set the material block with quantity transfer is when it is common for several users to work on the same material simultaneously. If this is not the case in your organization, you can work with the conventional blocking logic at material-plant level. In Customizing, the material block can be set with quantity transfer under Define checking group. If this block is active, the material is blocked only for the duration of the availability check when you create or change a sales and distribution document. Thus, it is possible for several users to process the same material simultaneously in various transactions without blocking each other. During the availability check, the material being used is blocked exclusively in the current plant as in a conventional block. December 1999\\n\\n15\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nControlling the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nIf another user tries to process the blocked material in the corresponding plant while the availability check is being carried out, the system tries five times to block the material exclusively for this other transaction with a pause of about 1 second between each attempt. If the fifth attempt is unsuccessful, the check is terminated and the transaction remains unconfirmed. To confirm the transaction, the user must call up the availability check again. After completion of the check, the corresponding confirmed quantities are still blocked, but not exclusively. The material block is removed. The non-exclusive quantity block then supplies information to users working in other transactions, on the reserved quantities of the corresponding material being processed in the selected plant. The block entries are removed when processing is completed. If the transaction processed was saved, then the block entries were only removed after the relevant changes to the data base have been carried out. You create a sales order for a material. During the availability check, this material is blocked. After the availability check is completed, the block is removed. The quantity reserved for this transaction is recorded in the blocking table. This information can be assessed by all others who are working with this material. If you save the order, the blocked entries are cancelled. During manual backorder processing, a material with a quantity block is blocked exclusively so that an availability check for this material is no longer possible. If both of the blocking options are active, the block with quantity transfer takes precedence. 16\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nTiming of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nTiming of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing When you create an order, the system determines the required materail availability date on the basis of the customer’s requested delivery date. On this date, you must begin picking, packing, labeling, and loading the goods. Therefore, this is the date of significance for requirements planning on which the availability should be checked. The following data is required for determining this date:\\n\\nRoute from the shipping point to the ship-to party location\\n\\nShipping point from which the goods are issued\\n\\nLoading group from the material master record\\n\\nWeight group determined from the order using the order quantity\\n\\nScheduling\\n\\nThis data, which you have already entered in the system, means that scheduling can occur automatically. Since scheduling is carried out backwards from the requested delivery date, it is also called backward scheduling. If backward scheduling determines that the preparation for the shipping activities should have been started already to meet the customer's requested delivery date, the system then starts forward scheduling automatically from the current date. For more information on scheduling, see Transportation and Delivery Scheduling [Ext.]. December 1999\\n\\n17\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nScope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nScope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing The following elements can be included in the availability check:\\n\\nStock\\n\\n− safety stock\\n\\n− stock in transfer\\n\\n− quality inspection\\n\\n− blocked stock\\n\\n\\n\\nInward/Outward movement of goods\\n\\n− purchase orders\\n\\n− purchase requisitions\\n\\n− planned orders\\n\\n− production orders\\n\\n−\\n\\nreservations\\n\\n− dependent reservations\\n\\n− dependent requirements\\n\\n− sales requirements\\n\\n− delivery requirements\\n\\nRequirements in sales and distribution (sales requirements and delivery requirements) result from all transactions which forward a requirement to Materials Management (MM) or to Production Planning (PP). For example, this could include sales orders or deliveries and quotations as well. Sales and distribution requirements reduce existing stock or inward movements of stock on the material availability date to ensure that other outward movement of stock elements cannot access the quantity reserved in this way. Requirements relevant for Sales and distribution are created in Sales and Distribution, whereas other elements in this list are created in Materials Management or in Production Planning. For further information on transfer of requirements, see Requirements in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 37]. Defining the Elements to be Included in Check\\n\\nA checking rule is assigned to each transaction. This rule in combination with the checking group controls the scope of the availability check. You can use the checking rules in Customizing for Sales to specify for the various transactions which of the elements listed above should be included in the availability check. For trading goods it does not make sense to include planned or production orders, for example, in the availability check. However, for products manufactured by your company these orders should be included in the check. 18\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nScope of the Availability Check in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nFor transactions such as make-to-order production, consignment or returnable packaging processing that create special stock, the availability check is performed against special stock. If it is defined by the checking rules that both sales and delivery requirements are taken into account in the availability check in sales documents but only delivery requirements are taken into account in the availability check in deliveries, there is a danger that quantities reserved in the sales documents are considered to be available by the availability check in the deliveries. This can lead to sales documents becoming backlogged.

The system determines these proposals on the basis of the availability situation. This screen also provides you with information on the scope of the check, the current ATP quantity, and the availability situation across all plants. Availability Control\\n\\nOn the Availability Control screen, you can choose between the following delivery proposals:\\n\\nOne-time delivery on the requested delivery date\\n\\nIn this section, the system checks whether the requested delivery date can be kept to.

When availability is checked including replenishment lead time, the date which is proposed in this section is the date on which the replenishment lead time period ends if the stock before the end of replenishment lead time does not cover the order quantity. When availability is checked excluding replenishment lead time, the system bases its calculations on the stock and the planned inward movements of stock. To copy this data into the sales document, select Edit →=Complete delivery\\n\\nDelivery proposal\\n\\nIn this section, the system checks whether and for which dates partial deliveries can be made. Partial deliveries are displayed for different dates. These dates are based on the planned inward and outward movements of stock. During an availability check which takes replenishment lead time into account, the date on which replenishment lead time ends is displayed if insufficient stock means that no partial deliveries can be made before replenishment lead time ends. During an availability check which does not take replenishment lead time into account, the system displays the dates on which partial deliveries can be made with the available stock.

You can record the customer's decision either by setting an indicator in the Fixed date and qty field or by leaving this field blank. The field is displayed both on the schedule line overview screen and on the availability screen. Customer Accepts the Schedule Line Proposal\\n\\nIf the customer accepts the schedule lines which are proposed by the system, mark the Fixed date and qty field. The system then transfers the requirements for the schedule lines to material requirements planning. Customer Requires Goods Earlier\\n\\nIf the customer requires the goods earlier than the date that the system can confirm after the availability check, leave the Fixed date and qty field blank. The system then only passes on the requirements for the requested delivery date and does not take the quantities and dates confirmed by the system after the availability check into account. In this case, it is assumed that the requested delivery date can be kept to because, for example, additional production capacity may become free. The system only confirms the sales order once the entire order quantity can be delivered on the requested delivery date. In the subsequent delivery processing, the sales order is only considered to be completed when the entire order quantity has been delivered or when all partial delivery agreements have been fulfilled. A fixed item is considered to be completed once the entire confirmed quantity (which can be smaller than the originally requested order quantity)has been delivered. Therefore, it does not make sense to fix the confirmed quantity to 0 as the item is considered to be completed from the start.

If you enter such a delivery block in a sales order header, the system confirms the available quantity to show you the delivery options. If you save the document, however, the confirmed quantities are not saved. Your company could block confirmation for a customer if this customer's credit worthiness was questionable. The sales order in this case is not only classed as unconfirmed, it is also blocked for delivery. Thus, no stock is reserved. The stock is still available for other customers. Although the order quantities are not confirmed, the system still transfers the requirements to material requirements planning. It is assumed that the delivery block will be removed at some point. The automatic transfer of requirements means that the order quantity can be confirmed at a later point in time.

The system checks whether ATP quantities arise in the period before the delivery date. If so, the new sales order reduces the ATP quantities if the ATP dates come befor the delivery date. If a planned inward movement of goods is delayed to a desired date after the confirmed date, then the confirmation of the sales order remains in place without a stock coverage being given. This is because a change to inward movement of goods does not necessarily change the order.

Planning consumption and the allocation of the various consumption strategies are activated in Customizing and are dependent on the requirements class. Prerequisite for planning consumption is that the relevant sales and distribution applications perform transfer of requirements. If the availability check is also switched on, the check is carried out against the ATP (available to promise) quantity rather than the planning quantity. However, a consumption quantity is still forwarded in the requirements record. Allocating Independent Requirements in the Sales Document\\n\\nIf planning allocation takes place for an item during sales processing, the planning allocation control screen appears if the independent requirements allocated to the material do not cover the order quantity. This screen is identical to the availability control screen. The planning allocation control screen does not appear if the availability check is switched on for the resulting schedule line category. Reducing Independent Requirements\\n\\nIndependent requirements from planning are reduced by the goods issue posting in the delivery. The quantity decrease is determined from the consumption quantity which is transferred for the relevant item in the underlying order, as well as from the appropriate consumption period and mode. You enter the consumption mode and the consumption period in the MRP 3 screen in the material master record. Consumption Mode\\n\\nThe consumption mode defines whether and in which direction on the time axis from the requirements date the consumption of customer requirements with planned independent requirements should occur. The requirements date corresponds to the date the sales order items were created. You have the following options:\\n\\nNo planning consumption\\n\\nBackwards consumption only\\n\\nStarting from the requirements date, backwards consumption is carried out within the relevant consumption period. December 1999\\n\\n45\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAllocating and Reducing Independent Requirements in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nForwards consumption only\\n\\nStarting from the requirements date, forward consumption is carried out within the relevant consumption period. Backwards/forwards consumption\\n\\nStarting from the requirements date, backwards consumption is performed first of all. Then, if no planned independent requirements can be allocated before the requirements date, forward consumption is performed. Both procedures are carried out for the relevant consumption period. Forwards/backwards consumption\\n\\nStarting from the requirements date, forward consumption is performed first of all. Then, if no independent requirements can be allocated after the requirements date, backwards consumption is performed. Both procedures are carried out for the relevant consumption period. Consumption Period\\n\\nYou can enter a consumption interval for both backwards and forwards consumption. This interval determines the consumption period. If backwards/forwards consumption or forwards/backwards consumption is activated, both consumption periods are taken into account. Planning Material\\n\\nYou can create a common planning material and assign similar materials to it. Independent requirements are created for the planning material to cover the requirements which are expected for the materials assigned to the planning material. Thus, customer requirements for these materials are consumed by the independent requirements of the planning material. This means that you do not have to create independent requirements for each material. You assign the planning material to the materials on the MRP 3 screen. You must also enter the appropriate strategy group for planning with planning materials on the MRP 1 screen. You cannot perform the transfer of requirements with the availability check when planning is carried out using planning materials. Displaying Allocations\\n\\nYou can display the quantities allocated by planning consumption to a material for which planning is carried out. For example, to display the quantities allocated to a planning material, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Select Logistics →=Production →=Master planning →=Demand management on the main menu screen. You reach the Demand Management screen. 2. Select Evaluations →=Displ.total reqmts. You reach the Display Total Requirements screen.'),\n",

However, if only some of the order quantity can be confirmed or a delivery proposal is created, these two amounts can deviate from each other so that the display of the ATP quantities only corresponds to the material requirements planning viewpoint and the availability situation for sales can only be taken from the control screen for the check.

This check is carried out along the same lines as in the sales order. It makes sense to carry out an availability check in the delivery for the following reasons. If you do not carry out an availability check for particular materials in the sales order, you should definitely check whether the order quantity is available and can be delivered when you create the delivery. Even if you have checked the availability situation in the order, it makes sense to check it once again in the delivery. The availability check is calculated using planned inward and outward movements of goods. Therefore the delivery situation might have changed in the meantime due to unforeseen circumstances, such as lost output. The availability check in the delivery takes any such changes into account. 50\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nWorking with the Availability Check in Shipping\\n\\nWorking with the Availability Check in Shipping When you create the delivery for a sales order, the sales order requirement is reduced by the delivery quantity. A delivery requirement which is transferred to material requirements planning is created at the same time. You can define whether delivery requirements are managed as individual or collective requirements. Collective requirements can include, for example, requirements from all deliveries for one particular day or week. The availability check treats these delivery requirements as outward movements of goods.

The availability check in deliveries is dependent upon the requirements class which itself is linked to the requirements type of the material. In addition, delivery item categories can be used to control whether an availability check is performed in deliveries. Prerequisites\\n\\nAn availability check can only be carried out if the following prerequisites have been fulfilled:\\n\\nControl elements for the availability check must be maintained in Customizing and appropriately assigned to the sales and distribution transactions\\n\\nThe availability check and the transfer of requirements must be switched on at requirements class level and may not be deactvated at item level.

If the system determines that insufficient stock will be available on that date, it responds as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a material is not available for delivery by the material availability date, the system enters a delivery quantity of zero in the delivery. The item is only included in the delivery if the quantity zero is permitted for the item category. If the quantity available of a material is lower than the order quantity, the system enters the available quantity as the delivery quantity. If a partial delivery is not allowed for the sales order, the fact that the delivery quantity is smaller than the order quantity is noted in the log for the delivery.

Unforseen problems, such as production deficits or increased demand can have critical consequences for order processing and must be brought under control as soon as possible. Product allocation is a function provided by the R/3 system for carrying out these control options intended to help your company to avoid critical requirement and procurement situations. This should enable you to keep production to a minimum at the same time as allowing you to react quickly to bottlenecks and changing market situations. In the R/3 system, product allocations represent an ordered allocation of production for certain periods. Product allocations can be created according to various criteria (i.e., customer, regions). Product allocations are created in the logistics controlling area in the planning hierarchy (Logistics →=Logist. controlling →=Flexible planning →=Planning create/change →=Planning type: COMMIT for SAP standard planning type). Product allocations are always divided right up to the lowest level in the hierarchy. The basis for the planning hierarchy is info structure “S140”, which SAP issues as the standard info structure. It determines the criteria of the hierarchy. You can define your own info structures in Customizing for LIS (Logistics General →=Logistics Information System →=Reporting →=Standard Analyses →=Change settings). When creating product allocations, make sure that you use version number “000”.Because updates are carried out for this version number. If a product allocation of 5000 pieces were to be entered at the material level as depicted in the diagram below, it would be automatically distributed among the lower levels\\n\\n(= consistent planning). Changes are possible at every level, but the other levels are still adjusted automatically. As of Release 3.0F, it is possible to carry out an availability check against product allocations. The check is still carried out if neither the availability check nor transfer of requirements are\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n55\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProduct Allocation\\n\\nactivated in Customizing. This ensures, for example, that when production is low, the first customer does not get the full amount, resulting in following sales orders not being confirmed or being confirmed far too late. The check is carried out on the basis of the confirmed quantity from the ATP check against the corresponding product allocation. To get reliable information and to recognise critical situations, the actual requirements are compared with the planning product allocations throughout the entire product allocation period. General Requirements\\n\\nTo carry out availability check against product allocation, certain requirements must be met:\\n\\nMaterial master\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the material master, the product allocation determination procedure must be entered in the basic data screen for general data. Statistics update\\n\\nIn Customizing for the Logistics Information System, statistics updating must be set for the information structure.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='This is required at customer, material and header level. The update group must also be maintained in Customizing for the Logistics Information System. In Customizing for SD, the settings must be made for availability check against product allocation. You will find the necessary steps described in the Implementation Guide in section “Availability check against product allocations”. This is where, the necessary Customizing activities for the statistics update are described. 56\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nAvailability Check Against Product Allocation During Order Entry SD\\n\\nAvailability Check Against Product Allocation During Order Entry SD The planning hierarchies for product allocations are created in logistics controlling. If the correct settings have been made in Customiuing, the system carries out an availability check against the ATP quantity in SD during order entry. If the availability check determines that the ATP quantity can fully or partially cover the order requirement, then a confirmed quantity is determined as the result of the check. The confirmed quantity is the basis for the availability check against product allocation, which is carried out along with the ATP check. The confirmed quantity from the ATP check is checked against the relevant product allocation. This ensures that the product allocation for this period is not exceeded. Required quantities that cannot be confirmed, because the product allocation for that period is used up, are postponed until the next period. The result of the product allocation check can change confirmed quantities that have already been determined. In this case you receive a message before branching to the availability control screen. For example, even though the material for an order for 100 pieces may be available in full for the required date according to the ATP check, it is only partially confirmed because the product allocation for that customer only had a value of 80 pieces remaining at the time of order entry. The confirmed quantity for the required quantity and an alternative delivery date is displayed on the control screen. Unlike the ATP check, the check date for the availability check against product allocations is the planned delivery date for the customer and not the material availability date. The actual order quantities are updated in the planning hierarchy of the LIS. Comprehensive reporting tools and an early warning system in the LIS that has to be set in Customizing monitor the status of the product allocation period and report critical situations immediately.

Afterwards, the same object can also be used by other processes without the current procedure having been saved. The product allocation quantity used is, however, seen in all subsequent processes (via this blocking mechanism) to prevent over-confirmation. 58\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAvailability Check and Requirements in Sales and D\\n\\nDisplay Availability Check Against Product Allocation\\n\\nDisplay Availability Check Against Product Allocation The system can carry out an availability check against product allocation automatically during order entry.

For example, if your customer base includes multi-level buying groups,cooperatives, or chains of retail outlets, you can create hierarchies to reflect the structure ofthese groups. You use customer hierarchies in order and billing document processing for partner\\nand pricing determination (including rebate determination) and for creating statistics.\\nYou can use customer hierarchies to assign price conditions and rebate agreements to one of\\nthe customer’s subordinate levels, to ensure that all subordinate levels are valid for the customer.For each node that you indicate as relevant for pricing, you can create condition records forpricing. If one or more nodes in a hierarchy path for a sales order contain pricing data, this isautomatically taken into account in pricing.\\nIntegration\\nYou can also use customer hierarchies for evaluations in profitability analysis (CO-PA) and in the\\nSales Information System (SIS):\\nTo evaluate customer hierarchies with the sales information system and in the profitability\\nanalysis, you can maintain the field Hierarchy assignment  on the Marketing  tab page in the\\ncustomer master record for a hierarchy customer. Here you can maintain 10 features for\\nhierarchy customers  (HIEZU01 to HIEZU10). You can use these to evaluate hierarchies\\nstatistically with up to 10 levels. (Field catalogue VHIE)\\nNote that the hierarchy assignment is statistical. If you change the customer\\nhierarchy, you may need to change the hierarchy level manually in the customer\\nmaster record in the Hierarchy assignment field.\\nFeatures\\nA customer hierarchy is a flexible structure consisting of customers . Each customer - with the\\nexception of the uppermost customer - refers to another customer at a higher level in the\\nhierarchy (known as a higher-level customer ). Customers that are assigned to higher-level\\ncustomers are known as dependent customers .\\nTo be able to display organizational elements, that are not independent partners, you can assign\\npure hierarchy nodes  (account group 0012) in the hierarchy. Specific data can be assigned to a\\nhierarchy node (for example, address, price conditions, rebate agreements) and this then applies\\nto all subordinate customers.\\nAs all nodes in a hierarchy are time-dependent, you can adapt the customer hierarchy to\\nchanges in the structure of a customer at any time.\\n• Customers can be reassigned in a hierarchy When reassigning a customer, all subordinate\\ncustomers are moved with it\\n• You can add new customers to a hierarchy When you assign a new customer to an existing\\nhierarchy, all pricing data, that applies to the higher-level hierarchy node, is automatically\\ncopied from the customer', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If you leave the valid-to date blank, the system automatically proposes 12/31/9999.\\nYou may want to define a temporary reassignment for a node for which you havealready defined a future change. The following example shows how the systemre-establishes the validity period in this case. There are two assignments for node\\n4712: a current assignment and a future assignment that becomes valid on the\\n01.01. 1995.

This screenselection applying specifically to an application is called a \"view\".\\nThe following are examples of possible material types in the SAP standard version:\\n• Trading Goods\\n• Non-stock Material\\n• Services\\n• Packaging Material\\nTrading Goods\\nTrading goods are movable goods intended for commercial exchange. Examples of trading\\ngoods are market goods, consumption goods and durable goods. Trading goods are always\\nbought and re-sold by your company. The material master record for trading goods thereforealways contains purchasing data and sales data. Trading goods are managed in the SAP R/3System using the key HAWA.\\nNon-stock Material\\nNon-stock material includes materials that are not managed on an inventory basis (for example,small parts such as nails) though physically in stock. Non-stock materials are managed in theSAP System using the key NLAG.\\nServices\\nServices are represented and managed in the SAP System as materials. Services are immaterial\\ngoods that differ from other goods, particularly in that their production and consumption coincide.\\nServices are generally regarded as non-transportable and non-stockable. Typical services arecommercial services, transport services, bank and insurance services, goods from culturalorganizations and the mass media, as well as services provided by the public security forces orthe education and health sectors.\\nSince services cannot be stored, a material master record of this material type does not contain\\ninventory data or inventory management data. No fields for gross weight, net weight or unit of\\nweight are included in the basic data for a service, as are for other material types. Services aremanaged in the SAP R/3 System with the key DIEN.\\nPackaging Material\\nThis material type includes all materials needed for packaging.

The materials can therefore be grouped by the company to meet\\ntheir specific demands. The groupings are determined and defined by the system administrator.\\nContact him, if you have questions concerning the existing groupings.\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 System the following groupings are possible, for example:\\n• Material Group\\n• Material Pricing Group\\n• Product Hierarchy\\nMaterial Group\\nGoods with the same features (for example, nails) can be grouped using the field Material group.\\nUnlike the product hierarchy, the material group does not contain different levels or possiblecombinations of goods. You can, however, use the material group to carry out different analysisfunctions.\\nThe material group is defined by a nine-digit, alphanumeric key. It is not primarily of importance\\nfor sales and distribution, but is used mainly in materials management.\\nMaterial Pricing Group\\nA further option for grouping materials is represented by the material pricing group. This can be\\nused both for pricing as well as for evaluation and analysis. The material pricing group is definedby a two-digit, numeric key.\\nProduct Hierarchy\\nThe product hierarchy is used to group materials by combining different features. It is used for\\nanalyses and pricing. A product hierarchy can consist of up to eighteen characters. Its features\\ncan be combined in various ways.

In the SAP R/3\\nSystem, you can therefore define various units of measure which are maintained in the sales anddistribution screens. However, you only need to maintain the fields of the units of measure if theydeviate from the base unit of measure. If no other fields with units of measure are maintained, the\\nsystem automatically takes the base unit of measure as a basis for its calculations. You can enter\\nthe following units of measure in the sales and distribution screens:\\n• Base Unit of Measure\\n• Alternative Unit of Measure\\n• Sales Unit\\n• Delivery Unit\\nBase Unit of Measure\\nStocks of a material are managed in the base unit of measure. All quantity movements in other\\nunits of measure are converted automatically by the system into the base unit of measure.\\nAlternative Unit of Measure\\nAs soon as units of measures other than the base unit of measure are used in a material masterrecord, the system prompts you in a dialog box to enter a calculation factor to the base unit ofmeasure, the so-called alternative unit of measure. The alternative unit of measure does not referto an entry field in one of the sales and distribution screens. It is either requested in a dialog box\\nor entered on a secondary screen, which you can access by pressing \\nF5 (Unit of measure) .\\nSeveral alternative units of measure can be defined.\\nIf, for example, a product is managed in the base unit of measure \"Piece\" but is sold in the sales\\nunit \"Box\", you must define the conversion factor. The alternative unit of measure can define, for\\nexample, that 1 box of this material contains 12 pieces.\\nSales Unit\\nThe unit of measure in which materials are sold is referred to as a sales unit (for example, piece\\nor bottle). The value you define in the material master record is proposed during businesstransactions relevant for sales, such as the sales order. You can replace them with otheralternative units of measure in the sales order.\\nDelivery Unit\\nThe delivery unit refers to the unit in which materials can be delivered.

To use them again, youcan just copy them.\\nThe system does not run the standard checks (pricing, availability, incompleteness, material\\ndetermination, free goods determination, and so on) until you enter the order quantities.\\nThe product proposal acts both as an entry aid and also an aid to sales support and promotions.\\nIt is particularly useful tool in the telephone sales area. During sales document processing thematerials, that are particularly relevant for a particular customer, are displayed to the processor.This enables them to provide appropriate advice to the customer quickly and easily. You can usethe sales document history to analyze the customer's purchasing habits and recognizestraightaway if their behavior changes, for when instance when they suddenly stop ordering a\\nproduct.\\nThe product proposal differs from cross selling in that it is dependent on the customer and sales\\narea, and is therefore displayed in the sales document as soon as you have entered a customer.Cross selling, on the other hand, is triggered by the material.

The system then checks if the business partneris authorized to release against the contract.\\nDepending on the settings in Customizing, the system determines whether a partner is\\nauthorized to release against the contract by checking against one of the following:\\n• Partners in the contract (Rule A)\\nIf the partner has the partner function AG (sold-to party) or AA (sold-to party for release\\norder) in the contract, the system accepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release\\norder.\\n• Partners in the hierarchy (Rule B)\\nIf the partner who wants to release against the contract is the sold-to party of the contract\\nor at a lower level in customer hierarchy to the sold-to party in the contract, the system\\naccepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release order.\\nAfter the authorization check, the system also checks if more than one ship-to party is defined in\\nthe contract. If the contract contains a WE (ship-to party) and several AWs (ship-to party for\\nrelease order), the system lists the possible ship-to parties in a dialog box. You select the\\nappropriate ship-to party for the release order.\\nYou can define authorized sold-to parties (AA) and additional ship-to parties (AW) inthe customer master record. When you create a contract for the customer, thesepartners are proposed for selection.\\nPrerequisites\\nYou activate the partner authorization check in the Customizing activity ‘Define Sales DocumentTypes’.\\nPartner determination procedure KAB (partners in contract) contains the partner functions AA\\nand AW. You must assign this procedure to the sales document types for which the partner\\nauthorization check is relevant. You make this assignment in the Customizing activity ‘Define and\\nassign partner determination procedures’.\\nIn the standard R/3 System, the partner releasing against the contract and the ship-to party\\nwhich you select are copied into the release order. If you want to control which partners arecopied into the release order, you can define a copying routine for the relevant document types in\\nthe Customizing activity ‘Maintain Copying Control for Sales Documents’. For example, you can\\nspecify that only the sold-to party releasing against the contract is copied into the release orderand the other partners are determined from the customer master record of the sold-to party.\\nFeatures\\nIf rule B is defined for the contract type, you can search for authorized partners for a release\\norder using the contract number.

If you change the original text, thishas no effect on the text in the follow-up document.\\nYou can also change the copied text without affecting the corresponding text in a preceding or\\nfollow-up document.\\nReferencing texts\\nIf a text is referenced, then it only appears once in the database: In the documents in which the\\ntext appears, the original text is merely referred to as a reference. If you change the reference\\ntext later, the referenced text is automatically changed with it.\\nAs soon as you change a referenced text, the system automatically deletes the reference to the\\nrelevant reference text. The text is then duplicated and becomes an independent text, which is nolonger affected by changes made to the reference text.\\nThe reference remains lifted, if you change a text and then undo the changes again\\nlater.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If you define standard texts, they are included inthe sales and distribution forms when they are issued.\\nSome standard texts to which you can refer in the sales and distribution documents have been\\ndefined in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.\\nNotes on Entering Text\\nYou can use standard texts to give notes to the employee entering an sales and distributiondocument regarding the information he should include in specific header or item texts and thesequence in which he should do it. For example, by including a standard text such as a headernote in the sales document, you can make sure that the employee specifies in the first linewhether the customer has taken advantage of a sales promotion in his purchase order and in the\\nsecond line, how (newspaper, radio etc.) he found out about the promotion.\\nProposals from the Master Records\\nThe standard text above must first of all be created and then included in a text in the customer\\nmaster. You can define in Customizing whether this text is automatically proposed from thecustomer master record in the header note of the document header when you create a salesdocument.\\nStandard texts can be proposed in the documents at header and item level in the same way from\\nthe material master record.\\nCreate\\nTo create a standard text, proceed as follows:\\n1. Select Tools →→→→ SAPscript  →→→→ Standard text on the main menu screen.\\n2. Enter a name for the text to be created in the field Text name, the indicator ST in the field\\nText-ID, and the abbreviation for the language in which you want to create the text in thefield Language.\\n3. Select Create/Change.\\n You switch to the SAPscript editor. If no standard text has been created with this name,\\nthe following message is displayed: Text <text name> language <language indicator> is\\nnew\\n4.

These are\\ngrouped into four categories:\\n• Pre-sales documents: inquiries and quotations\\n• Sales orders\\n• Outline agreements, such as contracts and scheduling agreements\\n• Customer problems and complaints, leading to free-of-charge deliveries and credit memo\\nrequests\\nIf your particular business processes require it, you can process deliveries and billing documents\\ndirectly from a sales document. In addition, some sales documents, such as cash sales [Page\\n126] and rush orders [Page 128] automatically trigger the creation of subsequent delivery and\\nbilling documents.\\nBasic Functions Within Sales Order Processing\\nDuring sales order processing, the system carries out basic functions, such as:\\n• Monitoring sales transactions\\n• Checking for availability\\n• Transferring requirements to materials planning (MRP)\\n• Delivery scheduling\\n• Calculating pricing and taxes\\n• Checking credit limits\\n• Creating printed or electronically transmitted documents (confirmations and so on)\\nDepending on how your system is configured, these functions may be completely automated or\\nmay also require some manual processing. The data that results from these basic functions (for\\nexample, shipping dates, confirmed quantities, prices and discounts) is stored in the salesdocument where it can be displayed and, in some cases, changed manually during subsequentprocessing.\\nDocument Flow in Sales\\nThe sales documents you create are individual documents but they can also form part of a chainof inter-related documents. For example, you may record a customer’s telephone inquiry in thesystem. The customer next requests a quotation, which you then create by referring to the\\ninquiry. The customer later places an order on the basis of the quotation and you create a sales\\norder with reference to the quotation. You ship the goods and bill the customer. After delivery ofthe goods, the customer claims credit for some damaged goods and you create a free-of-chargedelivery with reference to the sales order. The entire chain of documents – the inquiry, thequotation, the sales order, the delivery, the invoice, and the subsequent delivery free of charge –\\ncreates a document flow or history. The flow of data from one document into another reduces\\nmanual activity and makes problem resolution easier. Inquiry and quotation management in theSales Information System help you to plan and control your sales.

You can alter the width of the columns and their sequence to\\nsuit your way of working by simply dragging the mouse. You can then save your different versionof the display as a variant.\\nAn essential element of the interface is the tab page which looks like a box of index cards where\\nyou can easily find what you need. Each tab page has a title which is constantly visible. Bysimply clicking on the tab page title, you can bring the page in the box into the background, and\\nprocess it if necessary.\\nThis tab page technique means that all the data that belongs together can be displayed together,\\neven if the display area available is limited.\\nThe essential data in a sales document is contained on the following screens; each screen in the\\nstandard system has several tab pages:\\n• Overview screen Tab pages: Sales, Item overview, Ordering party, Procurement, Shipping,\\nReason for rejection\\n• Header screen Tab pages: Sales, Shipping, Billing, Payment slips, Billing plan, Accounting,\\nConditions, Partners, Texts, Purchase order data, Status, Additional data A and B\\n• Item screen Tab pages: Sales A and B, Shipping, Billing, Country, Conditions, Account\\nassignment, Schedule lines, Partners, Texts, Purchase order data, Status, Structure,\\nAdditional data A and B\\nYou can also use icons to help you to switch between these tab pages quickly and easily.\\nOverview Screen\\nThe overview screen provides the user with a choice of data for the document header.

You can find further information on this in the implementation guide.\\nHeader Screen\\nThe header screen contains several tab pages with data from the document header.\\nBefore Release 4.0, you could switch from the Business Data  screen to the three detail screens\\nSales, Shipping  and Billing.  The data for these detail screens is now on the Sales, Shipping,\\nBilling document and Accounting tab pages for the header screen, making it easier to reach than\\npreviously. As of 4.0, the data from the Business Data  screen is divided between the relevant tab\\npages.\\nInstead of the additional data screen, there are now two tab pages for  Additional Data A  and\\nAdditional Data B  and the latter can be designed to suit your needs.\\nItem Screen\\nThe item screen displays data on an individual item for the document. Even here, there are\\nseveral tab pages to choose from. Similar to the header screen, the tab pages in the item screen\\nmake data from the previous three detail screens for sales, shipping and billing directlyaccessible. The Business Data  screen no longer exists here either and instead you can find the\\nfields from this screen in the Sales A, Sales B, Shipping  and Billing  tab pages.\\nThere are two pages for sales data ( Sales A  and Sales B ), allowing full display of the tab pages\\neven on smaller screens. The previous data in the Additional Data  screen has now also been\\ndivided into two pages ( Additional Data A  and Additional Data B ).\\nAdditional Screens\\nSchedule Lines\\nThe overview, header and item screens do not contain all the data for a sales document. Instead,\\nyou can go to the Schedule line  tab page from the Item screen to see a schedule line in the\\nSchedule Line  screen. (This can also be done by double-clicking on the magnifying glass under\\nthe schedule line table.) This screen contains detailed information for a single schedule line.\\nScheduling Agreements\\nUp to three scheduling agreement releases with different delivery schedule release types\\n(forecast, just-in-time, or planning delivery schedules) can be assigned to one scheduling\\nagreement item. Each delivery schedule comprises general data for the scheduling agreementrelease (release header) and a list of schedule lines in the delivery schedule. The items in thescheduling agreement do not have schedule lines so, in contrast to the other types of salesdocument, there are no tab pages here for schedule lines.\\nThere are tab pages for forecast delivery schedule, JIT delivery schedule and planning delivery\\nschedule. These pages are displayed independantly of the scheduling agreement type. The\\npages provide an overview of the current delivery schedule, with data for the delivery scheduleheader in the upper area, and a list of schedule lines in the delivery schedule below.

The conditions of the quotation then apply to the resultingsales order.\\nSystem Reaction to Full Reference\\nIn the standard system, if full reference is specified for copying a reference document, youcannot change or delete an item when you copy from the selection list. If you subsequently try tochange the document quantity or try to delete an item in the new document, you receive asystem message.\\nCompletion rules\\nYour system administrator can define completion for referenced items by item category in\\nCustomizing for Sales and Distribution. An item may be considered fully referenced if one of the\\nfollowing criteria have been met:\\n• An item is complete as soon as it is used as a reference. In this case, the item is fully\\nreferenced, even if only a part of the quantity is copied.\\n• An item is only complete once the full quantity has been copied into a subsequent\\ndocument. If the item is partially referenced, it is possible to enter several sales\\ndocuments for the item until the quantity is fully accounted for.\\n• An item is only complete once the target quantity (in a contract, for example) has been\\ncopied into a subsequent document. If the item is partially referenced, it is possible to\\nenter several sales documents for the item until the quantity is fully accounted for.\\nThe standard version of the system defines an inquiry item as complete even if only one part of\\nthe inquiry quantity has been copied into a quotation. On the other hand, when you copy aquotation into a sales order, the quotation is not complete until the quotation quantity has beenfully referenced.

However, subsequent functionscan often only be carried out if the data in the original sales document is complete. To guaranteecompleteness, the system logs all missing data in an incompletion log. The data needed toprocess subsequent functions is defined by your system administrator for each sales documenttype. For example, when entering a quotation, you must enter a validity period.

You can also specify the sequence inwhich the materials are to be displayed in the product proposal.\\nDuring sales document processing, the system displays a product proposal in the item overview,\\naccording to the customer and business transaction. It displays the material number, materialdescription and the historical order quantities in the sales unit last used. To use them again, youcan just copy them.\\nThe system does not run the standard checks (pricing, availability, incompleteness, material\\ndetermination, free goods determination, and so on) until you enter the order quantities.\\nThe product proposal acts both as an entry aid and also an aid to sales support and promotions.\\nIt is particularly useful tool in the telephone sales area. During sales document processing thematerials, that are particularly relevant for a particular customer, are displayed to the processor.This enables them to provide appropriate advice to the customer quickly and easily. You can usethe sales document history to analyze the customer's purchasing habits and recognizestraightaway if their behavior changes, for when instance when they suddenly stop ordering a\\nproduct.\\nThe product proposal differs from cross selling in that it is dependent on the customer and sales\\narea, and is therefore displayed in the sales document as soon as you have entered a customer.Cross selling, on the other hand, is triggered by the material. In other words, the systemproposes cross-selling materials according to the material or a characteristic of the material you\\nhave entered.\\nPrerequisites\\nYou must make the following settings in Customizing:\\n• Define the customer pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n• Define the document pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n• Assign the document pricing procedure for the product proposal to sales document types\\n• Maintain the table of origin for the product proposal\\n• Define the procedure for the product proposal and specify the access sequences\\n• Maintain procedure determination (in background) for the product proposal\\n• Maintain procedure determination (online) for the product proposal\\nYou can find these settings in Customizing for Sales and Distribution under Basic Functions .

Customer inquiries and quotations to the customer can be entered andmonitored.\\nFor example, a customer inquires whether you have a certain product in your warehouse, how\\nmuch it will cost, or whether the product will be available for a certain date. The inquiry is\\ntherefore a request from the customer for you to provide him with a sales quotation.\\nA quotation presents the customer with a legally binding offer for delivering a product or providing\\na service within certain fixed conditions.\\nThe data you store in sales queries forms the basis of subsequent documents and, if you wish,\\nsales analysis.\\nCreating and maintaining this kind of data may be useful under, for example, the following\\ncircumstances:\\n• You want to evaluate your pre-sales processing with reports and analysis. For example,\\nyou want to compare the value of a quotation against the value of subsequent sales\\norders and invoices and then evaluate the effectiveness of your planning process. Or youwant to evaluate the success rate of quotation-to-order conversion by salesman or salesgroup.\\n• Your sales organization deals with government agencies or large organizations and\\ninstitutions who routinely send out for bids and requests for proposal. You want to record\\nthe entire sales cycle.\\n• Your sales organization sells a wide range or low value products (for example, consumer\\nproducts with a high turnover) but you wish to fix certain data for the presales phase if\\nyou are negotiating for larger contracts.\\nA company sends out quotations for equipping intensive care rooms in hospitals.

If this is not corrected, it can lead to unnecessaryhandling, shipping costs, and returns. But you can have the system track down and correct these\\nerrors before they go out the door.\\nSAP Retail can search for all sales documents that have the same customer, currency, and total\\nvalue of the order. From this list you can select pairs of documents and have R/3 drill down intothe individual line items. If at least one of the line items differs between the two orders, thesystem will automatically let both orders proceed. If, on the other hand, the line items are allidentical, you can then examine the individual sales and choose which one you want to remove\\n(for example, if one order has been partially delivered and the other has not, you would want to\\nremove the one that has not yet been processed). This way you can catch unintentionalduplication at an early stage and thereby reduce the frequency of merchandise returns.\\nActivities\\nWhen you run the duplicate order report, the system will list all the sales documents matching thecriteria you have selected. Next to each customer, there will be either a green or yellow button:\\n• A green button indicates that there are no duplicate sales documents.\\n• A yellow button indicates that one or more sales documents for this customer have the same\\ncurrency and total order value.\\nFor each customer with a yellow button, you can further expand the list to show all sales\\ndocuments. Individual sales orders will now have either a green or yellow button. Again, theyellow button indicates a possible duplication.\\nYou can select any two − and only two − sales documents at a time, then press a button to have\\nthe system do a further analysis of the two. If the items within the sales documents are different,\\nthe yellow button will become green, indicating that there are no problems. But if all items matchcompletely, a red button appears. You can then click on each of the sales documents to examine\\nthem, then decide which of the two to remove.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A value contract can contain certain materials or a group of materials (product hierarchy,assortment module).\\nUse\\nThe value contract contains rules that specify the kind of release orders that are allowed. You\\ncan define restrictions on customers and materials. In addition to the sold-to party, you can\\nspecify the other partners who are authorized to release against the contract by assigning the\\npartner function AA to them. You can also define additional ship-to parties for release orders\\nusing the partner function AW. For further information, see Authorized Partners for Release\\nOrders [Page 161] .\\nIn the value contract you can refer to lists of materials that have already been defined. This list\\ncould be a product hierarchy or a assortment module (for more information, see Assortment\\nModule for Value Contracts [Page 150] ). However you also create a value contract for only one\\nmaterial (for example, a configurable material).\\nTo fulfill both these requirements, two types of value contracts are offered in the standard\\nsystem:\\n• Value contract type WK 1\\nYou can specify a product hierarchy or a assortment module for value contracts with\\ncontract type WK 1. The system will always propose this type of contract, if you want tocreate a contract for several materials or a certain group of materials. All the materials in\\nthe relevant assortment, or belonging to the specified product hierarchy are then relevant\\nfor release.\\n• Value contract type WK 2 (material-related)\\nYou can create contracts for one material (usually configurable) with this type of value\\ncontract. A software company is an example of where this kind of contract is often used.\\nThere, a contract for the value of $500,000 is made with the customer for one specific\\nsoftware product.\\nYou can also agree on the length of the contract for this type. The contract duration canbe agreed at item level and can be different from the contract duration specified at\\nheader level.\\nYou can store special price agreements for the value contract. These price agreements can then\\nbe used at any level. For example, a value contract can contain prices for individual materials, ordiscounts that are valid for every released material.\\nRelease Orders\\nThe customer fulfills a contract by issuing orders against the contract.

Create a customer master record for the special stock partner (account groups 0001  and\\nDEBI  are defined for this purpose in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System).\\n2. Enter the special stock partner in the relevant customer master record on the partner\\nscreen using the partner function SB.\\nWhen you create an order for this customer, the system automatically proposes the partner\\nfunction SB in the document header and the document items.

You can also enter the partner function SB manually in the\\ndocument header or in the relevant items if a special stock partner is required and is notproposed from the customer master record.

The customer is only required to pay you for the returnablepackaging if he does not return it to you by a specified time. Using this function you can, forexample, process euro-pallets. You can also use it to resell returnable packaging to a third party.\\nSince stocks of returnable packaging form part of your valuated stock even when they are at the\\ncustomer site, you must manage them in your system.\\nHowever, stocks of returnable packaging must be\\n• Managed separately from the rest of your stock so that you know exactly what stock is stored\\nat the customer location\\n• Managed separately for each customer\\nInventory management treats returnable packaging as \\nspecial stock  in your inventory and is\\nassigned to specific customers. This enables you to keep track of returnable packaging stock bycustomer.\\nPrerequisites\\nSettings in the Material Master Record\\nA prerequisite for returnable packaging processing is that the value LEIH  (returnable packaging)\\nis entered in the material master record on the second sales screen in the Item category group\\nfield. This entry in combination with the document type automatically determines the appropriate\\nitem category for each transaction involving the material.\\nSettings for the Special Stock Partner\\nYou must define a special stock partner for processing returnable packaging when a third party is\\ninvolved. This means you can manage all special stock under one partner. You might use this\\npartner function if your customer, for example, uses a decentralized order processing system butmanages returnable packaging centrally. You can also use this partner function to processreturnable packaging when a carrier is involved (for example, for euro-pallets). If you want toprocess returnable packaging using the special stock partner, first make the settings which are\\ndescribed for Consignment Stock Processing [Page 216] .\\nIf you want to manage returnable packaging for a carrier, for whom a vendor record\\nalready exists, you must also create a customer master record for the carrier. Youare then able to assign returnable packaging stock to the carrier.\\nProcess Flow\\nThere are three main transactions for processing returnable packaging, all of which supportseparate inventory management:\\n• Creating Returnable Packaging Shipments [Page 229]\\n• Creating Returnable Packaging Pick-Up [Page 230]', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

During\\nsales order processing, you simply enter the returnable packaging as an item in your order. Youcan process returnable packaging either as main items or as sub-items. For example, if you selldrinks in bottles and want the empty bottles to be returned, you can enter the bottles as sub-\\nitems for the drinks in the sales order. The item category group  \\nLEIH  must be assigned to the\\nbottles in the material master record so that they are processed as returnable packaging. During\\nprocessing, the system recognizes that it is dealing with returnable packaging because the item\\ncategory group LEIH  is assigned to the material. The system then determines another item\\ncategory in the sales order to allow the material to be processed as returnable packaging. As a\\nresult of entering returnable packaging in a sales order, the system carries out the following\\nactions:\\n• If special stock does not yet exist in your inventory for the customer (or special stock\\npartner), the system creates it when goods issue is posted\\n• The relevant quantity is removed from regular inventory in your plant and is added to the\\nspecial stock for the customer. The total valuated stock for the plant remains the same.\\n• The transaction is not relevant for pricing since the consignment stock remains the property\\nof your company.\\nReturnable Packaging Pick-Up\\nIf the customer returns the returnable packaging to you, you record the transaction in the system\\nby creating a returnable packaging pick-up order (order type LA). As a result, the system carriesout the following actions:\\n• When goods issue is posted, the relevant quantity is deducted from the customer’s special\\nstock and is added back into your regular stock at the plant where the goods are returned.\\nYour total valuated stock remains the same since the returned stock was regarded as part ofyour own inventory even while it was at the customer’s premises.\\n• This transaction is not relevant for billing.\\nReturnable Packaging Issue\\nIn the following situations, you can create a returnable packaging issue order (order type LN):\\n• The customer decides to keep the returnable packaging\\n• The customer damages the returnable packaging and you decide to charge the customer\\n• The customer sells the returnable packaging to a third party\\n \\n As a result of processing a returnable packaging issue, the system carries out the following\\nactions:\\n• When goods issue is posted, the relevant quantity is deducted from both the customer’s\\nspecial stock and your own total valuated stock.\\n• The transaction is relevant for billing since the goods have become the property of the\\ncustomer.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In contrast to mass production for an unspecified market where a material ismanufactured many times, in make-to-order production a material is created only once thoughthe same or a similar production process might be repeated at a later time.\\nYou can use make-to-order production:\\n• For branches of industry or products where a small quantity of products with a large number\\nof different characteristics are manufactured\\n• When a product has to be assembled particularly for a sales order\\nStockkeeping is not usually carried out for products that are made to order. In companies using\\nmake-to-order production, the demand program only determines the production area, in whichvarious variant types are produced. Depending on how you track the costs associated with make-\\nto-order production, there are two ways to process make-to-order items during sales order\\nprocessing:\\nMake-to-Order Production: Cost Management Using the Sales Order [Page 234]\\nMake-to-Order Production: Cost Management Using the Project System [Page 249]\\nUsing Assembly Orders\\nYou can also use a sales order to create an assembly order for a make-to-order item.

Conditions\\nrepresent a set of circumstances that apply when a price is calculated. For example, a particular\\ncustomer orders a certain quantity of a particular product on a certain day. The variable factors\\nhere - the customer, the product, the order quantity, and the date - determine the final price the\\ncustomer gets. The information about each of these factors can be stored in the system as\\nmaster data. This master data is stored in the form of condition records .\\nThe Condition Technique in Pricing\\nThe condition technique  refers to the method by which the system determines prices from\\ninformation stored in condition records. In Sales and Distribution, the various elements used in\\nthe condition technique are set up and controlled in Customizing. During sales order processing,\\nthe system uses the condition technique to determine a variety of important pricing information.\\nFor example, the system automatically determines which gross price the customer should becharged and which discounts and surcharges are relevant given the conditions that apply.\\nExample of Pricing in the Sales Order\\nThe following figure shows how the condition technique works in the background to produce the\\npricing information. The diagram shows how the various elements in the condition technique\\nwork together.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The pricing procedure defines the valid condition types and the sequence in which they\\nappear in the sales order. In the example, the system takes the first condition type (PR00) inthe pricing procedure and begins the search for a valid condition record.\\n3. Each condition type in the pricing procedure can have an access sequence assigned to it. In\\nthis case, the system uses access sequence PR00. The system makes the specified\\naccesses until it finds a valid condition record. (Although this diagram does not show it, each\\naccess specifies a particular condition table. The table provides the key with which thesystem searches for records).\\n4. In the example, the first access (searching for a customer-specific material price) is\\nunsuccessful. The system moves on to the next access and finds a valid record.\\n5. The system determines the price according to information stored in the condition record. If a\\npricing scale exists, the system calculates the appropriate price. In the example, the sales\\norder item is for 120 pieces of the material. Using the scale price that applies to quantitiesfrom 100 pieces and more, the system determines a price of USD 99 per piece.\\nThe system repeats this process for each condition type in the pricing procedure determines a\\nfinal price.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It is organized to reflect the\\nlikely sequence of events that you go through when you implement pricing in Customizing. Thestandard R/3 System includes predefined elements for routine pricing activities. For example, thestandard system includes condition types for basic pricing elements, such as material prices,customer and material discounts, and surcharges such as freight and sales taxes. In the case of\\neach element, you can use the standard version, modify the standard version, or create entirely\\nnew definitions to suit your own business needs. The sequence of activities is generally asfollows:\\n1. Define condition types for each of the price elements (prices, discounts, and surcharges)\\nthat occur in your daily business transactions.\\n2.

It determines the sequence in which the system searches for data. The access\\nsequence consists of one or more accesses. The sequence of the accesses establishes whichcondition records have priority over others. The accesses tell the system where to look first,\\nsecond, and so on, until it finds a valid condition record. You specify an access sequence for\\neach condition type for which you create condition records.\\nThere are some condition types for which you do not create condition records(header discounts that you can only enter manually, for example). These conditiontypes do not require an access sequence.\\nExample of an Access Sequence\\nA sales department may offer customers different kinds of prices. The department\\nmay create, for example, the following condition records in the system:\\nA basic price for a materialA special customer-specific price for the same materialA price list for major customers\\nDuring sales order processing, a customer may, in theory, qualify for all three prices. The access\\nsequence enables the system to access the data records in a particular sequence until it finds a\\nvalid price.

The following kinds of price are predefined:\\n• Material price\\n• Price list type\\n• Customer-specific price\\nSelecting from Competing Pricing Records\\nDuring automatic pricing, the system looks for a gross price. Since you can store different kinds\\nof pricing information in the system, pricing records can compete with each other in certaincircumstances. For example, in addition to a basic material price, you may have a specialmaterial price for a particular customer.\\nIn the standard R/3 System, the system selects the most specific record - the customer-specific\\nprice. If no customer-specific price exists, the system looks for a valid price list type. If no valid\\nprice list type exists, the system takes the basic material price. This search strategy isdetermined during system configuration in Customizing for Sales and Distribution. For furtherinformation, see Access Sequences [Page 18] .\\nMaterial Prices\\nWhen you create a material price, you specify:\\n• A price or a pricing scale for a specific material\\n• A combination of sales organization and distribution channel for which the material price\\nis valid.\\nIn Customizing for Sales and Distribution, you can specify that pricing information\\nassigned to a particular combination of sales organization and distribution channelcan be shared by other combinations. For more information, see the online\\nImplementation Guide .\\nPrice List Types\\nDepending on your company’s pricing policies, you can define your own price list types to suit the\\nneeds of your business. For example, you can define price list types by customer groups\\n(wholesale, retail, and so on) and by currency (price lists for each foreign country you deal with).\\nCondition records are created for each price list type. You do this using the same organizationaldata as for material prices (sales organization, distribution channel). You can then assign pricelist types to each customer in the their master record.\\nCustomer-Specific Prices\\nIf you give special prices to different customers, you can create customer-specific pricingrecords.

However, theheader pricing screen also includes information about special condition types that you can applymanually at the header level and that apply to all items in the document. For example, you canmanually enter a discount that the system automatically distributes among the various itemsaccording to factors such as order quantity or weight. For further information on header\\nconditions, see Freight Costs [Page 29] .\\nItem Pricing Screen\\nThe item pricing screen displays details of each price element that applies to an item.

A header condition can be based on either a percentage or on an absolute amount. If you\\nenter a header condition that is based on a percentage (for example, a discount of 2%) thesystem automatically applies this percentage to all items in the document. If the header condition\\nis an absolute amount, there are two different ways in which the system can distribute the\\namount among the items in the document:\\nThe condition value of a header condition is either\\n• distributed proportionally among the items or\\n• the amount entered at header level is duplicated for each item.\\nYou control the distribution of absolute header conditions in the group price field per condition\\ntype. In the standard version, condition type HB00 is marked as a header condition and as group\\ncondition. Condition type RB00 is only marked as a header condition:\\nCondition type\\nDescription\\nHB00 Header discount distributed as percentage because it is marked\\nas a header condition and as a group condition\\nRB00 Assigns the header discount to every item, because it is only\\nmarked as a header condition\\nExample\\nThe following figure illustrates examples of the two variations. If you enter an absolute discount\\nwith condition type RB00 , the system takes the amount you enter as a header condition and\\ncopies the identical amount for each item in the document. In the example, the absolute discount\\nof USD 90 appears in each item. The total condition value for the document is USD 270.\\nHowever, if you enter an absolute discount with condition type HB00 , the system distributes the\\namount proportionally among the various items, in this case, according to value of the items. In\\nthe example, the absolute discount of USD 90 is distributed proportionally among the items. Thetotal condition value for the document is USD 90.\\nThe distribution of an absolute header condition need not be based on value.

All the pricing\\nelements of your daily business - the prices, discounts, and surcharges for freight and taxes -that you want to use for automatic pricing must be stored in the system as condition records. You\\ncan define as many condition records as you want for the different pricing elements for any\\nvalidity period.\\nYou create condition records for all the pricing elements that the system takes into account\\nduring automatic pricing. During document processing, the system transfers data from thecondition records and determines the amounts for individual pricing elements (prices, discountsand surcharges) and the final amount for the sales document.\\nOrganizational Level\\nPricing elements are generally managed at the sales organization and the distribution channellevel. Therefore you always have to specify the organizational level when creating conditionrecords. In the case of condition records for price groups, freight charges, and customer-specificprices and discounts, you must also enter the division. As a result, you can create conditionsaccording to product groups with these price elements.\\nCreating Condition Records With Reference\\nIf you want to create condition records based on records that already exist in the system, you can\\ncreate condition records with reference . Creating condition records with reference reduces the\\ndata entry effort considerably. This method of creating condition records is especially useful for\\ncreating records that have similar data to the reference but have different validity periods.\\nYou can overwrite any of the specifications of a condition record, thus using it as a reference.\\nWhen you save an altered condition record, the system creates a new condition record.\\n• \\n   Material prices can be maintained directly in the material master record. or you go\\nto the material master record and select Extras  →→→→ SD extras  →→→→ Sales price on the Sales\\nand Distribution screens 1 or 2, or on the Sales text screen. (You must select the\\nappropriate views beforehand).\\nMaintaining Pricing Related Master Data\\nDuring sales order processing the system can process some condition records only if\\ncorresponding data is maintained in the material or customer master records. If, for example, you\\nwant to apply discounts to certain customers by creating condition records for different price list\\ntypes, you must maintain data in each of the relevant customer master records.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For further information, see Pricing interval scales [Page 63] .\\nScale Basis\\nIn the standard system, a pricing scale can be based on any of the following criteria:\\n• Value\\n• Quantity\\n• Gross weight\\n• Net weight\\n• Volume\\n• A formula specific to your requirements\\nThe scale basis is defined in Customizing for Sales for each condition type.\\nCreating Scales\\nThe following procedure explains how to create a pricing scale for, as an example, a material\\nprice. You create pricing scales for other condition types in exactly the same way.\\nTo create a pricing scale:\\n1. Choose Goto → =Scales in the fast-entry screen of the condition record for a material\\nprice.\\n2. Enter a scale quantity and a rate.3. To save the condition record, choose Save .\\nSpecifying Scale Types\\nIn each condition record where you define a scale, you can further specify the scale type . The\\nscale type determines whether the scale is a From-scale  or a To-scale .

You can either\\ncopy one or more existing condition records into new records or you can create a new record anduse it as the basis for copying additional records, all in one step. You can copy condition recordseven when the source and target records have different condition types, condition tables, or key\\nfield values. However, copying between different condition types or condition tables is subject to\\ncertain prerequisites and rules.\\nPrerequisites for Copying\\nThe following general prerequisites apply to copying condition records:\\n• If the condition tables differ between the source and target condition records, then:\\n− Only one field may differ between the two condition tables\\n− The condition tables must contain the same number of fields\\n• If the condition types differ between the source and target condition records, then each\\ncondition type must have the same calculation rule, scale type, condition class, and\\nplus/minus indicator.\\nCopying Rules\\nCopying rules determine which condition types and condition tables you can use for copying\\nbetween source and target condition records. The rules are defined in Customizing for Sales and\\nmust meet the prerequisites listed above. The standard R/3 System contains standard copyingrules. If required, your system administrator can modify the standard copying rules or add newones to meet your requirements. During processing, you can select from alternative copyingrules, depending on what you are trying to copy.\\nExamples of Different Copying Scenarios\\nThe following three scenarios describe how you can copy condition records.\\nScenario 1: Same condition types/same condition tables\\nYou offer a special discount to a particular price group (a group of customers defined in the\\ncustomer master record). You want to make this discount available to other price groups by\\ncopying pricing details from the existing record. In this type of copying, the condition types [Page\\n12] (K020) and the condition tables [Page 14] (table 20) are identical for both source and target\\ncondition records. The only thing that varies in this case is the value of one of the key fields (the\\nPrice group field).\\nScenario 2: Same condition types/different condition tables\\nThe access sequences [Page 18]  for a particular condition type can be defined in Customizing for\\nSales so that it accesses more than one condition table. This means condition records with the\\nsame condition type can have different keys. You can also copy condition records where thecondition type is the same but the condition tables are different. Say you offer a material-specificdiscount to a particular price group (condition type K032, condition table 32).

Say you offer a special discount to a particular price group (condition type K020,condition table 20) as you did in the first scenario. Here, however, you want to copy this conditionrecord not to another price group but to a new customer-specific discount (condition type K007,condition table 7).

You may want to copy an\\nexisting condition record into a number of new condition records. In this case, you use thechange condition record function.

There is either immediate deletion or a\\ndeletion flag for archiving at a later date.

When deleting immediately,a dialog box can be created which indicates immediate deletion but offers a deletion flag as an\\nalternative.\\nDeletion Flag\\nYou can mark condition records for deletion. These are then no longer taken into consideration\\nduring automatic pricing. However they remain as condition records in the system until the nextarchiving update. This means you can reset a deletion and reactivate a condition record.\\nPhysical Deletion\\nIf you use physical deletion, the condition record disappears immediately. It is no longer available\\nduring condition record maintenance or pricing. This deletion cannot be reset once it has beencarried out. You have to recreate the condition record if you need it again. To be more exact, thereference to the condition record for pricing and condition record maintenance is deletedcompletely with physical deletion.

The deletion flag improves upwards\\ncompatibility in the system.\\nA pricing error can occur when using hierarchical accesses in combination with the deletion\\nindicator (See the hierarchical access documentation in the SAP library).\\nThe deletion flag used to be used as a replacement for a missing release procedure.

You can use these indices to display, change and\\ncreate condition records with reference. This transaction can include condition records withseveral condition types and tables. For example, you can use a condition index if you want to see\\nall condition records that apply to a particular product regardless of whether the records are\\nprices or discounts. In this case, you can use one of the standard condition indexes. Or you maywant to see a list of condition records that contain a particular sales deal and a material from auser-specified list of products. To display this information, you can create your own conditionindex.\\nCreating an Index\\nCreating a condition index is similar to creating a condition table. In Customizing for Sales, youselect the combination of fields that you want in the index key. The system automatically\\nproposes a list of permitted fields to choose from. The fields you specify for the key can have a\\nmaximum combined length of 100 characters. Further information on creating an index can befound in the IMG (Implementation Guide).\\nReorganizing an Index\\nReorganization  means updating an index with current data. The following are examples of when\\nthis might be required.\\n• After you create a new index and generate it, you want to fill the index with the current data in\\nyour system. (This also applies if you choose to activate one of the standard condition\\nindexes).\\n• After you specify that condition indexes should be updated for a particular condition type, you\\nwant to fill the indexes with the corresponding condition records that already exist.\\nPlease note that since the system has to read all the relevant condition records,\\nreorganization is automatically submitted as a background task.\\nActivating an Index\\nThe activation function displays a list of all available condition indexes and indicates which areactive. The system can use a condition index only when it is activated. Before you can use the\\nindexes that are delivered in the standard version, you must first activate them in Customizing for\\nSales. Some indices are activated automatically during generation. In addition, you must specifyone of the following index updating requirements for each condition index:\\n• Requirement 1: The index is updated when the user provides data for all fields in the index\\n• Requirement 2: The index is updated when the user provides data for at least the first index\\nfield\\nControlling Index Update by Condition Type\\nYou can specify for each condition type whether or not the system updates the condition indexes\\nwhen you post condition records.

You\\ncan, for example, define a type of rebate agreement and specify a number of different conditiontypes and condition tables. This idea was extended in Release 2.2 to meet the needs of some\\nindustries (for example, the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry) for managing marketing\\nprograms with extensive discount structures. There are two kinds of agreements:  promotions and\\nsales deals.\\nPromotions\\nA promotion  typically represents a high-level marketing plan for particular products or product\\nlines - for example, a promotion for a range of products during a specific sales cycle. A promotion\\ncan include a number of different sales deals. For example, if your promotion covers a range ofdifferent product lines, you can create separate sales deals for each product line.\\nSales Deals\\nSales deals  provide a finer focus for your promotional activities. In the example above, a\\npromotion includes separate sales deals for each product line. Within the sales deal for a productline you might want to be able to promote the products in different ways. You might, for example,want to offer customer-specific discounts in some cases and material-based discounts in others.You can then create specific condition records that are linked to the sales deal, or assign existingcondition records. If the sales deal is linked to a promotion, the condition record also contains the\\nnumber of the promotion. This makes it possible later on, for example, to list and analyze all the\\ncondition records that refer to a particular promotion.\\nDefining Agreement Types\\nBefore you can enter promotions and sales deals as master data in the system, you must firstdefine the types of agreements that you want to use. You define types of promotions and salesdeals in Customizing for Pricing in the section on pricing agreements in exactly the same way asyou define types of rebate agreements. For example, you can specify the number range which isto be used to assign identifying numbers to sales deals of a particular type. You might do this to\\ndistinguish between different product groups.\\nFor each type of agreement that you set up, you can specify the following data:\\n• Number ranges (internal and external) from which the identifying numbers for the\\nagreements are taken\\n• Condition types and condition tables that can be used in the agreement type\\n• Which overview screen the user sees when creating master data\\n• Which validity period is proposed as a default value\\n• Additional control data for the condition types that can be used for the agreement\\nCreating Master Data for Agreements\\nAfter you define the types of promotions and sales deals you want to use, you can enter the\\nmaster data in the system.

A sales order BOM could be part of a super BOM and the configuration objectdependencies.\\n• Unit costing\\nUnit costing is used if the system cannot access a sales order BOM.

As well as the direct material costs and the direct costs ofproduction, you can also determine material overhead costs, production overhead costs,distribution and administration costs or transportation and insurance costs.\\nSales order costing is controlled mainly via the costing variant. The costing variant is stored in\\nthe requirements class as a proposal value. In the requirements class, you also store the costingmethod and the costing sheet.\\nCopying Sales Order Costing to the SD Conditions\\nYou can copy the results of sales order costing to the SD conditions.

When using hierarchies of this kind, it may be necessary to use any numberof partial quantities (taken from the specified quantity of characteristics) to define the keys of thecondition tables. A simple example of this would be a price that is fixed for sales organization and\\ndistribution channel but otherwise depends upon either customer, material or both.\\nWithout hierarchy accesses, you would need to create a condition table for every combination\\nand assign all accesses to this table in a hierarchy within an access sequence. This would notonly take a great deal of time, but it would also reduce system performance and force the systemto use a rigidly fixed sequence of accesses.\\nThis represents a major drawback, especially for hierarchical data such as that representing a\\nproduct hierarchy or a customer hierarchy.\\nUsing the  function, the system can find variants of this kind with a single access to a condition\\ntable containing all the necessary fields in the variable key. It can then determine the requiredcondition record according to the relevant criteria.\\nPrerequisites\\nWhen creating an access sequence in a condition table for the fields of an access, the user hasthe option of defining which part of the key remains fixed and which part can vary (these are the\\nfree fields and the optional fields in condition maintenance). During access sequence\\nmaintenance, you assign priorities to the fields in the variable part of the key. These priorities areused to evaluate the relevance of the condition records determined using the fixed part of thekey.\\nIn Customizing for Pricing, you need to make the following settings in the access at field level:\\n• Processing type in access ( AType  field): By entering A, you indicate that it is a free field.\\nFree fields are optional fields during condition record maintenance, so that any combination\\nof characteristics can be created for an access.\\n• Evaluation of characteristics ( Prio field): You can assign a priority from 01 (high) to 99 (low).\\nThe records with the highest priorities are then made available in pricing.\\nThe quick entry screen for the condition records is not used. Mandatory entry is not used for the\\noptional fields.\\nWhen using hierarchical accesses, you should always use physical deletion and notthe deletion indicator. This is because condition records are determined using thepriority for hierarchical conditions before Pricing takes place. However the deletionindicator is not checked until Pricing has begun. This can lead to the following:\\nA condition record may have top priority for the hierarchical accesses and be\\ntransferred to Pricing. Using one of the deletion indicators however, the condition\\nrecord is then sent out of Pricing without a replacement.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The check against product allocations is controlled in the materialmaster and elsewhere in the system.\\nCheck on the Basis of the ATP Quantities\\nThe ATP quantity (ATP = Available To Promise) is calculated from the warehouse stock, theplanned inward movements of stock (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders) andthe planned outward movements of stock (sales orders, deliveries, reservations). This type ofcheck is performed dynamically for each transaction, taking into account the relevant stock and\\nplanned goods movements with or without replenishment lead time. Planned independent\\nrequirements are not taken into account here.\\nCheck against Product Allocation\\nProduct allocation facilitates period-based distribution of products for certain customers orregions. As of Release 3.0F, you can carry out an availability check against product allocation.This ensures, for example, that when production is low, the first customer does not get the fullamount, resulting in following sales orders not being confirmed or being confirmed far too late.\\nCheck against planning\\nThe check against planning is performed against independent requirements which are usually\\ncreated for an ‘anonymous’ market rather than being customer-specific (for example, in the\\nstrategy ‘Planning without assembly’, when production occurs only up to the stocking level). Theplanned independent requirements result from demand program planning and are used forplanning expected sales quantities independent of orders\\nWeitere Informationen hierzu erhalten Sie unter Allocating and Reducing Independent\\nRequirements in Sales and Distribution Processing [Page 45] .\\nIncluding Replenishment Lead Time\\nReplenishment lead time is the time that is needed to order or produce the requested material.\\nThe system determines replenishment lead time according to specific times defined by you in the\\nmaterial master record. Depending on the material type, replenishment lead time can becalculated according to various time periods. In the case of trading goods, for example, it isdetermined according to the planned delivery time, purchasing processing time, and the goodsreceipt processing time.\\nReplenishment lead time is only included in the check performed on the basis of the\\nATP quantity.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If the material availability\\ndate is calculated on the basis of the current date to lie after the replenishment lead time for the\\nitem, the item itself can be confirmed despite insufficient stock being available. In this case, thesystem assumes that any quantity requested by the customer can be procured by the materialavailability date and considers the goods to be available. Therefore, a binding confirmation canbe sent to the customer.\\nThe following figure shows such a case. The customer wants 20 pieces delivered in full by the\\nrequested delivery date. Using backward scheduling, the system determines a material\\navailability date. However, no goods are available. The inward movement of 100 pieces is usedup by an outward stock movement. Therefore no stock is available for the material availabilitydate determined by the system. If replenishment lead time were not taken into account, thefollowing situation would arise. The customer wants complete delivery. However, as a result offurther inward (50 pieces) and outward stock movements (40 pieces), the goods only become\\navailable shortly before the requested delivery date specified by the customer when 60 pieces\\nare added to the stock. Correspondingly, the delivery date resulting from this material availabilitydate would lie further in the future.\\nHowever, since replenishment lead time is taken into account during the availability check, the 20\\npieces ordered can be delivered before this date, namely at the end of the replenishment leadtime.\\nInward movement\\nOutward60100\\n1004050\\nearliest possible20today\\nRequested deliveryAvailabilityBackward scheduling\\ndatedate determined\\nby backward\\nscheduling\\navailability\\nmovementReplenishment lead time\\nTo ensure that the replenishment lead time can be correctly calculated, the required\\ntimes must be entered in the material master record.

This is necessary as the delivery date for a sales order which hasbeen confirmed on the day before replenishment lead time begins lies the next day within thereplenishment lead time period and this leads to insufficient stock being available.

As of Release 3.0, the strategy group is specified in the\\nmaterial master record in the MRP 1 Screen.  In Customizing, strategy groups are\\nassigned, dependent on plant, to MRP groups. If the strategy group is missing in the\\nmaterial master record, it is determined on the basis of the MRP group, if it has been\\nmaintained.\\nUp to Release 3.0, the strategy group is determined on the basis of the MRP group\\n• MRP group\\nThe MRP group combines materials from the point of view of material requirements\\nplanning. This enables you to control planning for these materials in a particular way\\nusing, for example, the strategy group, consumption mode and planning period. You\\nenter the MRP group in the material master in the MRP 1  screen. The strategy group is\\ndetermined from the MRP group.\\n• Planning Strategy\\nThe planning strategy specifies the requirements type for planning and customer\\nrequirements. This represents the decisive control feature for the interaction betweenProduction Planning and Sales and Distribution.\\n• MRP type and item category\\nIf no requirements type is found using the planning strategy, the system tries to\\ndetermine a corresponding requirements type on the basis of the MRP type and the itemcategory.\\nUntil 3.0C, determination of the requirements type via planning strategy has taken\\npriority.

The requirements\\ntype refers to the requirements class and its control features.\\n• Requirements Class\\nThe requirements class contains all control features for planning such as relevance for\\nplanning, requirements planning strategy and requirements consumption strategy. In\\naddition, it is specified at a global level whether an availability check is to take place for\\nthe material in the sales and distribution documents on the basis of the ATP quantity(ATP = available to promise) and whether requirements are to be passed on. A finerdegree of control can be obtained for sales documents using the schedule line category.\\nControl Features Specific to Sales and Distribution\\nThe following SD-specific control features need to be maintained in Customizing:\\n• Checking group\\nThe checking group controls whether the system is to create indivdual or collective\\nrequirements in sales and shipping processing. In addition, a material block for theavailability check with transfer of requirements can be set here. The checking group canalso be used to deactivate the availability check. This option was created especially for\\nthe assembly order so that when the bill of material is exploded in the assembly order,\\nthe individual components, if necessary, can be classified as non-critical parts as far asprocurement is concerned.\\nThe checking group specifies in combination with the checking rule the scope of the\\navailability check. It is proposed in the material master record on the basis of the materialtype and the plant, and copied into the sales and distribution documents.\\n• Checking Rule\\nYou use the checking rule to control the scope of the availability check for each\\ntransaction in sales and distribution. You also specify whether the check should be\\ncarried out including or excluding replenishment lead time. The individual checking rules\\ndefine by transaction, which stock and inward and outward movement of goods shouldbe taken into account for the availability check.\\n• Schedule line category\\nYou can control with the schedule line category whether an availability check and\\ntransfer of requirements should be carried out in the sales documents. The possiblesettings for this at schedule line level are dependent on the settings in the requirementsclass which is determined from the requirements type of the material.\\n• Delivery item category\\nThe delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes\\nplace in deliveries.\\nPrerequisites\\nAn availability check can only be carried out if the following prerequisites have been fulfilled:\\n• The control elements described above for the availability check must be maintained in\\nCustomizing for Sales and the relevant assignments made to the sales transactions\\n• The availability check must be switched on at requirements class level and - for the\\navailability check in the sales documents - at schedule line category level', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

At schedule line level, the settings are proposed\\nfrom the requirements class.\\nIf the availability check is switched on at requirements class level, it can be switched off at\\nschedule line level. However, you cannot switch on the availability check at schedule line level, ifit is switched off at requirements class level. You can make this setting at schedule line level. Butthe system ignores it and the setting for the requirements class applies.\\nAlso, at schedule line level when the availability check is switched on, the transfer of\\nrequirements can be switched off. For example, this makes sense for inquiries or sales\\ninformation.\\nThe settings specific to schedule lines for performing an availability check are only relevant for\\nsales documents. In the shipping documents, the settings from the requirements class and thedelivery item category are used. As with the schedule line category, the availability check can beswitched off as required in the delivery item category.\\nBlocking Logic\\nThere are two blocking concepts:\\n• Material block\\nIn Customizing, the Define material block for other users,  step is used to determine, by\\nchecking group and transaction (order/delivery), whether a material master record should\\nbe blocked for other users during an availability check. The block is set at material-plant\\nlevel and remains in place until you save the sales document.\\n• Material block with quantity transfer\\nFor performance-related reasons, the only time when it makes sense to set the\\nmaterial block with quantity transfer is when it is common for several users to workon the same material simultaneously. If this is not the case in your organization, youcan work with the conventional blocking logic at material-plant level.\\nIn Customizing, the material block can be set with quantity transfer under Define\\nchecking group . If this block is active, the material is blocked only for the duration of\\nthe availability check when you create or change a sales and distribution document.Thus, it is possible for several users to process the same material simultaneously invarious transactions without blocking each other.

It is a compilation of notes, tips, and tricks I have learned in various implementations while on assignment in over 17 countries.\\nAfter completing these projects I found myself with a whole spectrum of knowledge, \\ngleaned from day-to-day investigations and tasks as well as from the wonderful individuals I have had the pleasure of working with. This, coupled with the new functionalities released by SAP since the first publication in 2000, as well as the numerous requests by associates friends and colleagues forced me to compile this new version of how to implement the Sales and Distribution module of SAP .\\nI hope you will find this book to be a valuable source of trustworthy advice given in an \\neasy-to-access format with direct answers. Instead of having to read ten pages to obtain one point, my desire is that you find ten points in one page. \\nThis book is not only directed at the consultant implementing the SAP SD module, but \\nis also intended as a valuable tool for the IT/IS department left to maintain the system post-implementation. If one has a thirst for knowledge, one should be able to use the tools, tips, and techniques in this book to expand one’s capability within SAP generally, not only within SD.\\nThis book is not a remake nor a copy of the help files SAP offers, nor is it in any way \\ndirected or controlled by SAP . Nor does it intend to replace SAP training.\\nInstead it is intended to enhance your knowledge of the SD module in SAP . By providing \\neasily accessible implementation guides, fantastic time-saving tips, as well as direct easily accessible information on the do’s and don’ts of implementing and maintaining the sales and distribution module of SAP .\\nIn this book we have developed a few guidelines that will offer instant understanding \\nand promote ease of use.\\n• First, all transaction codes will be shown with square brackets—for example, \\n[SPRO]. The actual transaction code to be used in this case is SPRO without the brackets. (I have only identified them in brackets to quickly identify them as transaction codes and to differentiate them from tables.)\\n• Where you see this sign next to a paragraph it denotes a tip or trick. These tips and \\ntricks are fantastic time savers, and have been gathered the hard way. Be sure to make the most of them.\\n• Where you see this sign next to a paragraph it denotes a piece of advice or an area \\nfor you to notice.\\nxiii\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We will introduce the new SAP \\nterminologies and how the products are related. We then begin with basic data, such as how SAP functions and where it accesses the information in the system. We will go \\nthrough the different versions and structures of master data—material, customer, organizational, and all related data, followed by covering the Enterprise Structure, resulting in a clear picture of how the data is inter-related.\\nIntroduction to SAP\\nSAP was founded in 1972 in Walldorf, Germany. The name is an acronym for “Systeme, Anwendungen, Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung,” meaning “systems, applications, and products in data processing.” SAP is in a consistent state of change with over 9,000 developers and researchers adapting it to the market and striving to offer consistently better business solutions. As a result, the company is the world’s leading enterprise resource planning software provider.\\nWith over 30 years of experience and being utilized in over 25 industries and \\napproximately 34,600 companies, it is estimated that SAP has approximately 120 million users in more than 120 countries around the world. With such an impressive history it is not surprising that today SAP offers a wide range of solutions, products, and applications.\\nThis book is focused on the mySAP ERP application, which is the follow-up product to \\nSAP R/3 software. mySAP ERP is one of the applications within the mySAP Business Suite, which includes\\n• mySAP ERP\\n• mySAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)• mySAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM)• mySAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)• mySAP Product Lifestyle Management (PLM)\\nAt the time of writing this book, the latest release of mySAP ERP is SAP ERP Central \\nComponent (ECC6). Within mySAP ERP there are a number of applications, such as \\nFinancials and Manufacturing. Of these applications we are focusing on the Sales and Distribution application.\\n1CHAPTER\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These customized applications can be used in conjunction with powerful, alr eady \\nexisting applications of Netweaver to integrate with mySAP ERP , creating solutions ranging, for example, from seamless integration with Microsoft Office to customer- or supplier-facing web portals.\\nThis book is not a general list of functionalities found in the mySAP  Business Suite, nor \\ndoes it focus on all applications within mySAP ERP , nor is it a list of release notes listing the differences between R/3 and ECC. It is instead a compilation of over a decade of consultants’ hands-on SAP Sales and Distribution implementation advice, all based upon the latest release of mySAP ERP .\\nSAP Application Integration\\nSAP is an ERP software product that seamlessly integrates the different functions in a business (such as sales, procurement, and production). SAP provides rich functionality in each of these business areas without sacrificing the convenience of an integrated system.\\nThese applications update and process transactions in real time, allowing seemingly \\neffortless integration and communication between areas of a business. For example, you can create a billing document and release it to Accounting and observe the updated billing values in a customer analysis immediately, without having to wait for day-end or month-end processing.\\nThe SAPGUI\\nThe SAP graphical user interface, or SAPGUI, runs on all well-known operating systems. The appearance of the screens and the menus displayed on them are configurable.\\nIn ECC there are numerous SAPGUIs. For example, the basic SAP screen looks similar \\nto Figure 1-1. This screen will be referred to as the SAP menu. It is often obtainable by using transaction code [S000].\\nThere’s also a GUI available for SAP processes, for users without direct access to their \\ndesktop computer. This is possible through the use of a web portal as seen in Figure 1-2.\\nCustomizing Tools\\nThe cornerstone to SAP is the ability to configure the system to meet the needs of your business. This is done by customizing or adapting the system and application to r espond \\nlike your business.\\nThis is the process of mapping SAP to your business processes. An example of a business \\nprocess would be capturing a customer sales order.\\nThis process of configuring SAP is generally time consuming and costly, as one needs to \\nfully understand the business processes and then find a solution in SAP to meet these requirements and customize it in the system while at the same time taking into account best business practices, international standards, and possibly a bit of business re-engineering.\\nThe objective of this book is to teach you how to develop and enhance the Sales and \\nDistribution module of mySAP ERP to its fullest potential, using time-saving tips and techniques, in order for you to effectively meet your business objectives.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is especially true for Sales and Distribution processing. Master data creation, ownership, and maintenance are the responsibility of all modules. The structure and data within a company’s master data govern how the system is to respond to future transactions or analysis.\\nCustomer Master Data\\nCustomer master data in SD is divided into three main areas.\\n• Basic Data This data remains the same for the customer regardless of which organization he buys from your company. Examples of this type of data are the customer address and contact details.\\n• Organizational Data This is customer data related to your organizational structure—for example, the customer may prefer stock to be delivered from plant YX01 when an order is placed in a specific sales area. (Sales area is explained later.) The customer may then wish stock to be delivered from a plant closer to his location YX02 when a sales order is placed in another sales area. A customer master record may exist for many sales areas. You can then have different data for the different sales areas, even though you are taking the order from the same customer and using the same customer number.\\n• Company Code Data A customer master record must also have company-related data. This data is used for financial accounting purposes. An example of company code data is the reconciliation account. A customer master record may exist for more than one company code—for example, when you have more than one company in your organization and the customer can buy from any one of them.\\nA sales area is a specific combination of a sales organization, a distribution channel, and \\na division. The sales organization is the legal entity responsible for the sale. You usually have a sales organization for each company code. The distribution channel is the way you send your product to the market—for example, you may have a retail distribution channel and a wholesale distribution channel. A division is a product division—for example, original equipment or spare parts. The combination of these represents the sales area.

You must understand how the business functions and have \\nexhaustive knowledge of the impact of using specific elements to map the companies organizational structure into mySAP ERP .\\nOrganizational data is comprised of:\\n• A Sales Organization An organizational unit that sells and distributes products, negotiates terms of sale, and is responsible for these transactions.\\n• A Distribution Channel The channel through which materials or services reach customers. Typical distribution channels include Internet sales, wholesale, retail, and direct sales. You can assign a distribution channel to one or more sales organizations. A customer can be delivered from multiple distribution channels.  A material master record can be maintained with different sales organization and distribution channel views, allowing different data to be accessed—for example, the delivering plant.\\n• A Division Product groups can be defined for a wide-ranging spectrum of products. For every division you can make customer-specific agreements on, for example, partial deliveries, pricing, and terms of payment. Within a division you can carry out statistical analyses or set up separate marketing.\\nFigure 1-14 shows a basic organizational structure. In sales organization 1000, SD \\nbusiness transactions can be carried out for distribution channel 10 and 20 and division 01 and 02. In sales organization 2000 transactions can only be proccessed through distribution channel 10 and division 01 and 02. Likewise, transactions in sales or ganization 3000 can \\nonly be done through distribution channel 10 division 01.\\nSales organizations should be kept to a minimum; try to have only one per company \\ncode. You should have a very good business reason to have more than one sales organization per company code. For example, only have another sales organization if the company sells completely differently in an area—for example, if sales processed in Los Angeles are handled differently to sales processed in San Francisco.\\nA rule of thumb is that if the material can be sold in both sales organizations and there is \\none company code, then there should only be one sales organization.\\nSales \\norganization\\nDistribution \\nchannel\\nDivision\\n- Sales area1000Client\\n10 10 10 202000 3000\\n01 01 01 01 02 02 02FIGURE 1-14  \\nOrganizational data \\nin SAP\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, add a division to our 80 customer master views and we suddenly have 120 customer master views. However, add the division to the material master views, and we still end up with 80.\\nTIP To reduce the master data you require, you can combine sales areas for customer master data \\npurposes—see the Implementation Guide (IMG | Sales and Distribution | Master Data | Define Common Distribution Channels (and Division)).\\nWe know a sales area is compiled of a sales organization, a distribution channel, and a \\ndivision. A sales area is used for reporting purposes; all data relevant for sales can be \\ndefined per sales area. For example, you can define pricing per sales area, or do your sales information analyses per sales area. You can also control configuration based on the sales area—for example, you can allow some sales processes for one sales area (for example, product samples), but not for another.\\nSAP Customizing Implementation Guide\\nThe Implementation Guide is used to collectively group the areas that must be customized, as well as to form a structure for documentation.\\nAdditional information may be added to the guide to make navigation mor e simple. \\nFigure 1-15 shows the standard mySAP Implementation Guide.\\nIf you select the menu path (Additional Information | Application Components) you \\ncan see the application to which the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide node is assigned, as shown in Figure 1-16.

This will ensure the relevant sub-settings are also copied and the structural integrity of the new company code remains. This will save you a lot of time and get your new company code working immediately.

It is where production, procurement, and materials planning are executed. A \\nmaterial may exist within more than one plant. Also, stock is delivered to a customer from a plant, the availability check is carried out in a plant, and requirements are passed from the sales document into the stock requirements list (that is, a list of production or procurement requirements) of a plant.\\nA storage location defines a storage area for the stock in a plant. One or more plants are \\nassigned to a company code. And one or more storage locations are assigned to a plant.\\n• A plant can only exist within one company code. The plant, its buildings, equipment, \\nand stock all belong to the legal entity represented by the company code.\\n• A plant may be assigned to more than one combination of sales organization and \\ndistribution channel. So you may sell stock from the same plant into different sales areas.\\n• A plant may have more than one shipping point. (A shipping point may also be \\nassigned to more than one plant.) A shipping point is a place where deliveries are processed within the plant.\\nThe assignment of plants to company codes is depicted in Figure 1-21.Shipping points are defined in the Sales and Distribution application component.

However, deliveries are created for shipping points.\\nGenerally, companies create deliveries using a background job, running the delivery \\ndue list. The shipping point is used as a criterion for delivery cr eation, so if you have \\nexpress shipping and want the background job to run more frequently for these deliveries, it is advisable to have an express shipping point. This shipping point may be used for the scheduled background job and may be executed more frequently (for example, every  15 minutes) than the other shipping points.\\nYou can configure the shipping point to be defaulted automatically in the sales order or \\ndelivery based upon the plant (used in the sales document), loading gr oup (of the material), \\nand shipping condition (of the customer master). For example, for a plant in Southern California, if the loading group is air transport and the shipping condition is express, use the Express Air Transport Shipping Point. The person responsible for processing these deliveries will see the delivery in their delivery due list when the sales or der is saved.\\nIf the plant is in Northern California and the shipping condition is expr ess and the \\nloading group is road transport, another shipping point will be proposed. So the delivery will appear in another delivery due list.\\nHere is how you define your Shipping point.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Enterprise Structure | Definition | \\nLogistics Execution | Define, Copy, Delete, Check Shipping Point\\nA shipping point is the top level of organization in shipping. Deliveries are always \\ninitiated from exactly one shipping point. A shipping point can be subdivided into several loading points. A loading point is a voluntary entry, merely a subdivision of a shipping point. It is manually entered into the header data of the delivery. For example, if a shipping point has five loading bays, you may create five loading points in SAP to represent each one.FIGURE 1-21 Plant assignment to company codeClient\\nCompany \\ncodes001\\n0001\\n0001\\n0001 00010002\\n0004 0003\\n00030002\\n0002Plants\\nStorage \\nlocations\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is best shown by the association of sales organizations and plants. A plant is always linked to one company code, and can be linked to several sales organizations. This means that the plant is owned by the company code and can only take orders from and make deliveries to customers in its sales organization. This is illustrated in Figure 1-22.\\nIn Figure 1-22 Plants 1, 2, and 3 belong to Company code 1. Sales organization 1 uses \\nPlants 1 and 2. Sales organization 2 uses Plants 2 and 3. Sales organizations 1 and 2 can make cross-company sales for goods from Plants 4 or 5.\\nAfter you have defined your data, and the other application components have defined \\ntheirs (such as the company codes having been defined by FI and the plants by MM), it is time to assign the SD organizational data.\\nThe assignments are extremely easy settings to make once you understand how the \\nstructures should be built up (as explained previously).

Customer master records can represent different entities based on the role they play in the transaction. We’ll be using and discussing the following customer master records:\\n• Sold to Party The partner or customer that places the sales order request.\\n• Ship to Party The partner or customer that receives the delivery of the goods or services.\\n• Bill to Party The partner or customer that receives the invoice.\\n• Payer Party The partner or customer that is responsible for the payment of the invoice.\\nOther important customer master records are created, such as inter-company customers, \\nwhich represent the company that is behaving like a customer because they are placing orders with another company in the same client.\\nAnother important customer master record is a one-time customer, which is a customer \\nmaster record that represents a general customer. This may be used for customers that buy infrequently or who only transact with the business once. Instead of creating individual customer master records for each of these individuals, you can use the general customer master record.\\nTo create a customer master record in mySAP ECC, follow this menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Easy Access | SAP menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Master \\nData | Business Partner | Customer | Create\\n29CHAPTER\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This data applies to only one company code. Transaction code [XD01] is used to create customer master data, with company code relevant data.\\n• Sales and Distribution Data This data is only of interest for the sales and \\ndistribution area.

This \\nis a popular way to quickly create a new material from one that exists already and is very similar.\\nThere are a number of views you may select from. As with the customer master record, \\nyou have sales views as well as accounting views. A few relevant material master views are as follows:\\n• Accounting 1, 2 Valuation and costing information. Examples of fields would be \\nstandard price, past and future price, and moving average cost price.\\n• Material Requirements Planning (MRP) 1, 2, 3, 4 Information for material \\nrequirements planning (MRP) and consumption-based planning/inventory control/availability check. Examples of fields include safety stock level, planned delivery time, and reorder level for a material. A crucial field value for MM, PP , and SD is the MRP type, which will be covered with the schedule line categories in Chapter 3.\\n• Purchasing Data provided by Purchasing for a material. Examples of fields \\ninclude purchasing group responsible for a material, over- and under-delivery tolerances, and the order unit.\\n• General Plant Data Storage 1, 2 Information relating to the storage/warehousing \\nof a material. Examples of fields include unit of issue, batch management, and storage conditions.\\n• Sales Org Data 1, 2 and Sales—General/Plant data Information pertinent to sales \\norders and pricing. These views are most relevant for the SD team. Examples of fields include delivering plant, taxes, pricing reference material, and item category group. The availability check indicator, which controls how the system determines if stock is available for a sales order and when it will be available, is included here as well. These subjects are covered in detail in Chapter 3.\\nThe pricing reference material is a field where you can enter a material for which you \\nhave a material master record and prices in your system and that you wish to use as a reference for the material you are busy creating or editing. This means you can create the pricing master data for one material, and then let many materials in the material master reference that pricing. This is much better than maintaining the same pricing master data multiple times for many materials.\\nThe item category group is of utmost importance to SD. It covers how the material \\nbehaves from the sales quotation right through to the invoice. In fact, all sales documents are dependent on the value in this field. We will cover item category determination in Chapter 3.\\nMaterial Master Units of Measure\\nA material can be stored, transported, and sold in various units of measure.

You can enter the following units of measure in the Sales and \\nDistribution screens:\\n• Base Unit of Measure This is the unit of measure used as a basis for all transactions. \\nAll quantity movements in other units of measure, should any exist, are converted automatically by the system into the base unit of measure. For instance, the base unit of measure may be pieces—as an example, stock of widgets is managed in pieces.\\n• Alternative Unit of Measure If a product is managed in the base unit of measure \\n“piece” but is sold in the sales unit “box,” you must define the conversion factor . \\nThe alternative unit of measure can define, for example, that one box of this material contains five pieces.\\n• Sales Unit The unit of measure in which materials are sold is referred to as a sales \\nunit (for example, piece, box, or bottle). The value you define in the material master record is proposed during business transactions relevant for sales. You can replace them with other alternative units of measure in the sales order. For example, if you sell widgets in boxes, then you would use the box unit of measur e as the sales unit.\\n• Delivery Unit The delivery unit refers to the unit in which materials can be delivered. \\nOnly exact multiples of the delivery unit can be delivered. For example, with a delivery unit of 30 bottles, 30, 60, or 90 bottles can be delivered, but not 100 bottles.\\nQuantity Specifications\\nSAP uses two different quantity specifications for the material master record:\\n• Minimum Order Quantity The minimum order quantity refers to the minimum \\nquantity the customer must order. A warning message appears if the minimum order quantity is not reached during order entry.\\n• Minimum Delivery Quantity The minimum delivery quantity refers to the \\nminimum quantity you must deliver to the customer. The minimum delivery quantity is automatically checked during delivery processing. A warning message appears during delivery processing if you enter a delivery quantity lower than the minimum delivery quantity.\\nAs unusual as it may seem, should you wish to restrict the quantity a customer may \\norder, you should use a quantity contract as explained in Chapter 4.\\nCustomer-Material Info Records\\nCustomer-material information is information on a material that applies to a specific customer when they buy a specific material. For example, the customer may have its own description for your material. You can record this customer-specific information for a material in a customer-material info record.\\nThe data in the customer-material info record has priority when master data is copied \\ninto an SAP transaction. When you create a sales order, for example, the default material data will be copied from the customer-material info record. If that does not exist, SAP will use the material data for the sales area.\\nYou can create customer-material info records by using the following menu path.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is possible for two master data areas of mySAP ERP: For all master-relevant data and for all condition-relevant data. This negates the requirement for having multiple copies of master data, with the only differing parameter being the distribution channel or division.\\nYou would use this option when you do not want to differentiate the master data based \\non the sales organization. For example, if you define many sales divisions for reporting purposes, you will have to create customer master sales screens for every combination of sales organization, distribution channel, and division. But if you make the division common, then you only have to maintain the customer master sales scr eens for the various \\nsales organizations, distribution channels, and the common division.FIGURE 2-7 Item details of the customer-material info record.Copyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

(The four distribution channels could be telesales, r etail, \\nindustry, and wholesale.) Neither is there a difference in the customers details when they purchase through one channel or the other. Thus, you do not wish to create four views of customer master and material master records, based upon the four sales areas. Select one distribution channel and division to use as the master or common one—for example, r etail. \\nCreate the customer master records and material master records in the common distribution channel (retail). Then assign the other distribution channels you created in the organizational structure setup to this one.\\nWhenever SAP sees a distribution channel linked to the common distribution channel, it \\nwill use the master data for the common distribution channel.FIGURE 2-8 SAP Customizing Implementation Guide menu path for common distribution channels.Copyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Even if you should access a customer or material master in change mode and press \\nF4 (matchcode search help for possible entries) \\nand select telesales, industry, or wholesale, you will receive a message stating “Sales area is not defined……”\\nThe same is true for the sharing of conditions. If conditions are shared, you need only \\ncreate a condition in the distribution channel or division you are using as the reference. Obviously, this only pertains to conditions that are specific to the distribution channel and or division (that is, these fields are in the condition key).\\nCustomer Groups\\nThe customer group is a grouping of customers that is configured under master data in the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide. After defining the group and allocating it a two-digit alphanumeric key, you may assign the group to the customer master record.\\nThe customer group is a wonderful field that is copied into the header and item level of \\nthe sales document. This is very useful for reporting and pricing purposes.\\nYou can define the customer group using the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Master \\nData | Business Partners | Customers | Sales | Define Customer Gr oups [OVS9]\\n Simply assign a two-digit alphanumeric key to the text description you would best use \\nto define your customer grouping.\\nNow proceed to the customer master record [VD02] sales screen and enter the appropriate \\ncustomer group. Should you want this field to be a mandatory field, so that no customer master record may be created without this entry, you may define it as mandatory using the account group as we saw earlier in this chapter.\\nThe customer group is a field that can be used to generate statistics as well as to create \\ncondition records such as pricing—for example, should you wish to offer discounts per wholesale customer group, but not per retail customer group. It is especially useful as it is on the sales tab of the customer master record and therefore it is on the customer related table of the customer master record that is table KNVV .\\nSales Districts, Sales Offices, and Sales Groups\\nSales districts, sales offices, and sales groups can refer to differing geographical areas or regions, or merely used as a grouping term on the customer master record. In their truest use, a sales district refers to a region where the customer is located. The sales office refers to a sub-group of the sales district, and the sales group is a sub-group of the sales office. Often, the sales group is used to represent a sales team or even a sales person.\\nThese data fields are copied into the header and item data of the sales order. They can be \\nused for statistical purposes as well as for pricing.\\nThe company implementing SAP may have specific requirements pertaining to the \\nsales group—for example, by giving individual sales people’s names to each value in the list. If you use sales group in this sense, it is advisable to use a generic term—for example, Employee A.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For \\nexample, when an order is placed, you have the Sold-to Party placing the order. You may have a different Ship-to Party (entity receiving the delivery) for the order. The invoice may go to another entity called the Bill-to Party and still another entity may make the payment (the Payer).\\nAutomatic partner determination happens in the sales document, delivery, billing \\ndocuments, sales activities, and customer master record. This automatic partner determination is configurable. In this section, we’ll cover how to set up the partner determination, including what partners are possible in a business transaction, what partners are required, and what types of customers from the customer master can fulfill the partner roles. For example, you must have a Sold-to Party in the sales order. But the Sold-to Party cannot be a customer who is created as account group 0002 (the Ship-to Party).\\nTo configure partner determination, use the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic \\nFunctions | Partner Determination | Set Up Partner Determination\\nBy referring back to master data, covered earlier in this chapter, we see that each partner \\n(customer) master record is created on the basis of a specific account group—for example, Sold-to parties use account group 0001.\\nWe also note the four basic partner functions:\\nSP Sold-to Party (German -AG)\\nSH Ship-to Party (German -WE)\\nBP Bill-to Party (German -RE)\\nPY Payer (German -RG)\\nEach partner function may be assigned a partner type, which specifies whether this \\npartner is a customer (for example, partner type KU), contact person, vendor , etc.\\nThe overview screen is dependent on the option selected in the IMG.

Those account groups would not function \\nwithout a partner determination procedure being assigned to them. In Figure 2-17, we see \\nthe partner procedure AG assigned to the account group 0001.\\nBelow partner determination procedure assignment, partner functions are defined. For \\nexample, the partner determination procedure AG has the mandatory partner function AG. Let us look at the “definition” of the partner function AG in Figure 2-18. The definition of the partner function AG is shown as the highlighted value SP , which will be explained a little later.\\nIn Figure 2-18 you can see the Sold-to Party is partner type KU – customer.While the in-completion procedure assigned to the SP partner function is 07, this in-\\ncompletion procedure is used by the system to register partner fields that are not filled at the time of creating the sales order. The in-completion procedure then prompts the user to complete these fields with missing values.\\nWe will cover the “higher-level function” as well as the “customer hierarchy type” in \\nChapter 9 in “Customer Hierarchies.”\\nThe “unique in customer master” indicator is set for the Sold-to Party . This indicates \\nthat the system must only allow one entry of this partner function in the customer master record.

In \\nthis section we focus on the components of a sales document and how they ar e \\nconfigured.\\nOverview of a Sales Document\\nMany processes start with a sales document, usually a sales order. A delivery document is created based on the data in the sales order, and finally the billing document is created from the delivery data.\\nEach sales document is divided into three levels:\\n• Header Level (Table VBAK) This level of the sales document is responsible for \\nmaster data such as customer material master as well as sales area and organization data. The settings at document type control in the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide, which we will define later, determine how this sales document functions.\\n• Item Level (Table VBAP) This level of the sales document is responsible for \\nmaterial item data such as order quantity and material master data. This is controlled by the item category settings of the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide.\\n• Schedule Line (Table VBEP) This level of the sales document is responsible for \\ndelivery dates and delivery quantity. This is controlled by the schedule line item category settings of the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide.\\nIn addition, you have business data (table VBKD), which can exist at header or item \\nlevel. An example of business data is the incoterms for the sales order, which are copied from the ship to party master data into the sales order header business data. By default, this header business data applies to all the items on the sales order. You can change the incoterms at header level and the change will apply to all the items.\\n55CHAPTER\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This change applies only \\nto that item. So we have item business data. The header business data no longer applies to \\nthat item. Future changes to the header incoterms do not apply to the order item incoterms.\\nBasic Sales Order Process\\nA sales order  is a contractual agreement between a sales organization and a customer  \\n(Sold-to Party) for the supply of services or products over a specific period of time and in certain quantities.\\nA sales order gets the master data from the customer master record and the material \\nmaster record for a specific sales area. This data is manipulated into context according to the sales document type, item category, and schedule line category.\\nThe sales order can be created with a reference to a preceding document (for example, a \\nquotation), in which case the data from the preceding document is copied into the new document. Thus, the information of a quotation will be copied fr om the quotation into the \\nsales order.\\nWhen the delivery document is created, the sales order data is transferred into it, using \\nadditional delivery or shipping information for the delivery note.\\nFollowing the goods issue, the information is passed on to billing, if billing is necessary .\\nNOTE Integration with other modules can happen throughout the process. For example, an interface \\nwith warehouse management could happen during the delivery processing.\\nThe number of variables in the sales order process is vast; at the highest level, one could \\nhave a quotation followed by a contract followed by a call off sales order. We will not define \\nand configure every possible flow. Instead, we will configure the main building blocks used by most organizations for the Sales and Distribution business processes.\\nAs stated earlier, each document (quotation, order, delivery, or invoice) is represented \\nby a document type. For example, a standard quotation is AG, a standard sales order is TA (German), a standard delivery is LF, and a standard invoice is F2. Sales document types can have a translation into other languages, thus a sales order may be TA (German) or it may be OR (English).\\nSAP has a language translation table, where you may determine whether a user should \\nenter, for example, TA or OR as a sales document type representing order; when logged on in English, the system will propose OR automatically for order. To access the language translation table, choose SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution |  \\nSales| Sales Documents | Sales Document Header | Convert Language For Each Sales Document Type\\nWe will use the unconverted German version of sales document types unless otherwise \\nspecified. Thus, the above document flow would look like the following r epresentation of \\nsales document types: \\nAG \\n‡ TA ‡ LF ‡ F2\\nWe will map out the sales document flows valid for each section during the description of the section.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As we will see in the product \\nproposal defined later in this chapter, we use item number range 11 for internal and 12 for \\nexternal. You can see the relevant sequence in Figure 3-2.\\nTo create a new number range, first find the exact requirements of the business. They \\nmay want the number range to be shared by numerous document types, so it will have to have a large interval because it will number many transactions. You need to consider how many transactions will be processed so you can define a large enough number range.\\nFind an interval that is not yet used and select the Interval button.Next, enter your alphanumeric key (for example, Y1) followed by the From and To \\nnumbers for the range. Then indicate if the number range is internal or external.\\nFor most document types you may only want to use an internal number assignment.Should you be doing any data conversion of old documents—for example, sales \\ndocuments into new mySAP ECC6 documents—ensure your number range matches the permitted range of the country/legal entity. For example, in Brazil the number ranges are unique and one is not permitted to have gaps in sequence.\\nFIGURE 3-2 Number range intervals\\nCopyright by SAP AGInterval \\nbutton\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A client is the environment you \\nare working in. Generally, companies have a system with a client for each environment—for \\nexample, a development environment or the quality or production environment.\\nWhen transporting the number range interval, the intervals you have in the client you \\nare exporting into will be deleted first, then the number range and assigned status will be created in the new client. Also note that the number range assignments to document types or other objects are not transported with this manual transport. I recommend that you create the number ranges individually in each client rather than transport them. This is because if you transport the number ranges, you could cause a pr oblem with duplicate \\nentries in the database. If this situation happens, the SAP program will abort and the data will not be saved.\\nFor example: In client 001 you have a number range from 0000001 to 9999999. The \\ncurrent number is 000084. In client 002, you have the same number range, but the current number is 0003429. These represent records in the database. Now you transport from 001 to 002. Your new starting number is 0000084 in client 002. When you try and save the record, the system assigns 0000085 to the document. But document 0000085 alr eady exists in the \\ndatabase. The transaction terminates with an error and the data is not saved.\\nIn this case you need to check the last number in the table using transaction code [SE16] \\nor [SE16n] and then change the number range status to reflect the last number used. Then the next number assigned will be unique.\\nItem Proposals (Product Proposal)\\nAn item proposal is a list of materials and order quantities that are regularly ordered together by a customer. They are sales-area–specific and can be referenced when creating the sales order. Each time a sales order is created and the item proposal referenced, the system automatically copies the item proposal from which to select materials and quantities. This can greatly speed up order entry time by the sales people.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Master \\nData | Item Proposal | Define Item Proposal Types [VOV8] \\nUsing item proposals in the sales order is different than using bills of material in the \\nsales order. A bill of material (BOM) is a record linked to a material that details the individual components that make up the material. For example, a computer may have a BOM that consists of screen, keyboard, and processor. When you enter the computer material in the order, SAP will explode the BOM and enter the individual items instead. See Chapter 5 for more information.\\nItem proposals may be related or unrelated items. For example, if the customer is a \\nhardware store and they regularly order nails, screws, and hammers, you can create an item proposal with the nail, screw, and hammer materials.\\nThe list of document types seen in Figure 3-3 shows all the sales document types in the \\nsystem. We will look at them in detail later. To start your introduction to sales documents we will go through the configuration settings in this item proposal first.\\nSelect document type PV – Item Proposal and click the Details button as \\nshown here.\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

(It is best to leave this field as 100 percent for sales documents unless you wish to plan your material requirements based upon this setting and the respective setting in the customer master record.

Customers who \\nplace quotations may place a fixed order 80 percent of the time. This means that the \\nquote document probability is 80 percent. You can look at all the quotes in the system and be reasonably sure that you will have to deliver 80 percent of the quantity. So you can plan your MRP based on this value.\\n• Output application is used in output determination, which we’ll cover in Chapter 9. Output determination sets what outputs, such as printouts and e-mail messages, ar e \\ncreated.\\n• Screen sequence, display range, and function code for overview screens are all values that can be manipulated. They control how the interface is represented in the sales document—that is, should you wish the system to propose a different screen for quotations than for orders, you can change these entries. Generally, you need a skilled ABAP resource to create specialist screen overviews. The function code for overview screen determines which overview (or item list) screen users will see when they create a sales document of this type. For example, if a customer material is always used, you could default the overview screen to a screen that includes  \\nthis field.\\n• The incompletion procedure identifies which fields are considered incomplete if the values are null. This is covered in Chapter 4.\\n• Transaction group controls the data to be updated in the respective tables for each transaction of the respective document type.\\n• Document pricing procedure is an indicator that determines what pricing procedure the system will use in this sales order. For the purpose of product proposals, it is indicating “C.” Which is used in pricing procedure determination, please refer to pricing procedures in Chapter 8 for further data.\\nOnce you are satisfied with the settings, select the Copy button, as \\nshown here, then enter a key with the customer name range permitted by SAP starting with a Y or a Z, followed by a description.FIGURE 3-4 Sales document type – Settings for an Item proposal document type ( Continued)\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, a returns \\norder to receive goods back from a customer will function differently than a sales order or a quotation.\\nThe sales document is comprised of three general levels of data and control: \\n• The sales document header, which is controlled by the sales document type\\n• The sales document item, which is controlled by the sales item category\\n• The sales document schedule line, which is controlled by the schedule line category\\nThe sales document type controls the central header details of the sales order—for example, \\nthe pricing procedure to be assigned to the sales document, or what type of document the sales document is. For now, we will focus on the configuration of the standard basic sales order process for the document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Sales  | \\nSales Documents | Sales Document Header  | Define Sales Document T ypes [VOV8]\\nWhen dealing with the configuration of sales document types, generally one of two \\nfunctions are performed. One either creates a new document type or alters an existing document type. It is recommended you follow these few basic guidelines:\\n• When creating a new document type, one should always reference the document type that is the closest match to the one you are aiming to create. For example, should you need a new sales order document type, you should copy document type TA (OR in English). Once you have copied the document type, the system copies all assigned data such as item category, schedule line category determination, and copying rules. You can then make the changes from this copy.\\n• When you want to change an SAP document type, it is better for you to copy the document type and assign it a new name in the customer name range (Y  or Z). For \\nexample, if you wish to change the pricing procedure determination indicator for document type TA, it would be better to copy TA to ZTA and then make the changes. This leaves the SAP standard settings in place.\\nWe will next look at the configuration settings necessary for a sales order document type.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Should an \\nentry have existed in this field, this entry would have taken pr ecedence and \\noverwritten those found on the customer master record. The shipping condition value is used to determine the shipping point. See Chapter 6 for information on shipping point determination.\\n• The immediate delivery indicator is not set. This flag creates a delivery immediately after saving the sales order. So for each sales order you create, the delivery is created automatically by the system. The delivery is not completed and the picking, packing (if relevant), and goods issue must still be carried out.\\nBy referring to the billing section of the sales document type as seen in Figure 3-7, we \\ncan see the following data:\\n• This document is relevant for invoicing and for delivery-related invoicing, the system automatically uses invoice document type F2.\\n• When an order-related invoice is possible the system will use document type F2 for automatic processing as well. (This makes sense if you wish your order and delivery relevant products to be invoiced at the same time.) The inter-company billing document type for automatic processing is IV .\\n• There is no automatic posting of a billing block on the sales order. It may be necessary, however, to have a billing block for credit notes, which we will look at later in this chapter.\\n This means that the order cannot be billed until the billing block is removed. Using \\na billing block is a safety feature. For example, you may have a background job that creates invoices. When you save the order, this background job will see the order and then invoice it if it is for order-related billing. Using the billing block will prevent this from happening until the order has been checked and the billing block explicitly removed. The condition type for line items is used to determine the costing of the line item; it must be equal to the condition type allocated on your pricing procedure.\\n• The billing plan type is either periodic billing, where the entire value to be billed to date is billed in full on the billing plan date (for example, a r ental agr eement), or \\nmilestone billing, wher\\ne the total value to be billed is distributed between the \\nindividual billing plan dates (for example, for a project based on project milestones, where the value billed on each date can be a fixed amount or a percentage).\\n• Payment guarantee procedure indicates to the system what form of guarantee procedure to use for this sales document. These are risk management. For more information, see credit management Chapter 10.\\n• Payment card plan type is an essential setting should you want your system to accept payment cards in the sales order process.\\n• Checking group is used to determine how the system carries out the checking of payment card data.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The order reason may be used for the logistics information system (LIS), thus you may report on or use this field in a matrix for sales information.\\nShould the order reason be a crucial field for your reporting, you can assign it to an \\nincompletion log for the particular sales order to ensure no sales order may be saved or further processed until the order reason has been completed. For more information on incompletion logs see Chapter 4.\\nDefining Purchase Order Types for Sales Documents\\nThis is particularly useful for sales analyses. One is able to cr eate a default list of order \\nreasons to enable order capturing to determine whether the sales document originated from a telephone call or mail shot, or even to indicate the sale originated fr om the Internet.\\nThis is a useful grouping term, as seen in Figure 3-9.\\nSales Order Item Categories and Determination\\nThe sales item category is one of the most important fields in the SAP  sales order. It controls \\nthe sales document flow and also impacts the schedule line category. The item category  \\nof the sales order affects the delivery and finally impacts the billing process as well. Keeping to our basic sales flow, we will look at the integration of the item category into the following document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\\nDefining Item Categories\\nUnlike the sales document type, which is entered manually into the sales order at order creation, the item category is automatically determined by the system.

For standard processing this too can be left blank. However, should you wish to utilize these rules you must ensure you have set the update document flow indicator in copy control (see “Copy Control,” later in this chapter).You may use the completion rule if you use call-off orders for contracts for example. If the contract is for 1000 units, each time you create an order, the open quantity is adjusted for the new order. So if you create an order for 150 units, the open quantity on the contract becomes 850. The contract is complete either with the first order reference, but usually when the full quantity has been referenced.\\n• The special stock indicator should be set for items that are processed as special stock. For example, should you use consignment stock at your customer ’s site this \\nindicator should read W.

This is one of the most important item settings as it determines if the item is relevant for schedule lines and therefore delivering or not. Refer to schedule line categories later on in this chapter.\\n• Item relevant for delivery indicates to the system to copy the item from the sales order into the delivery note. This, however, should not be set for standard items, as a standard item would have a schedule line and thus be able to be determined as delivery-relevant. This flag should be used to indicate to the system to copy such items as text items into a delivery.\\n• Should the item be a returns item category—for example, REN—then the returns flag should be set.\\n• Weight/volume relevant is an indicator that tells the system if weight and volume are relevant and if the system should calculate these fields for these characteristics.\\n• Credit active indicates that this item is relevant for credit control updating and credit statistics. (For more information on credit management, see Chapter 10.)\\n• Determine cost is an indicator that tells the system to use the condition type VPRS on the pricing procedure to indicate the cost price of this item. (For more information on pricing, see Chapter 8.)\\nThe general control area seen in Figure 3-11 includes the following settings:\\n• Automatic batch determination indicates to the system to carry out batch determination for this item at the time of the sales order. (Batch determination is the process whereby one allocates a material batch to an item. This can happen at the time of the order, at the time of the delivery, or even in the warehouse management module. A batch refers to a quantity of material that shares the same characteristics. For example, if you are making blue paint, the color might be slightly variable based on the production batch, so customers may want to order the blue paint from the same batch.)\\n• Rounding is set in the customer material information record or the material master record and allows the system to round up or down the order quantity to make, for example, a specific package size. A materials base unit of measure is one unit. However the sales order must create orders in layers, where one layer is equivalent to five units; thus, the system will round the order quantity from say two units up to five units in the sales order.\\n• Order quantity is equal to one. This is self-explanatory. Check this indicator should you wish your sales item to be limited to a quantity of one per line item.\\nTransaction flow data (shown in Figure 3-12) controls the following:\\n• The incompletion procedure at line item level. This is explained in Chapter 4.\\n• The partner and text determination procedures are in Chapter 4.\\n• The item category statistics group is used by the logistics information system to indicate which item categories are relevant for statistical updating—for example, for sales reporting.

Figur e 3-13 \\nalso depicts configuration settings relevant for value contracts:\\n• The field for value contract material, may have a material number enter ed her e. \\nShould the user not enter a material at the line item level for a value contract, the system can then copy this material into the value contract item. This is useful for copying the material-r\\nelevant data such as tax determination into the value contract.\\n• Should the value contracts target quantity be exceeded, the system will respond according to the indicator set at the contract release control field.\\n• Service management has the repair procedure setting, which indicates the repair procedure that will be used for this item, which in turn determines which sub-items may be created in a sales order.\\n• Billing form determines how resource-related billing items are invoiced.\\n• Dip profile, the Dynamic Item Processor Profile, is used to calculate and summarize items to be billed for resource-related billing.\\nThis completes the configuration settings of a sales item category.

The \\nsystem finds a higher-level item category by looking at any linkage of items and then tracing back to the main item category. \\nFor example: A bill of materials (BOM) is a material that is made up of many component \\nmaterials. An example could be a computer, which could be sold as a computer but represented on the sales order as a monitor, a hard drive, a keyboard, and a mouse.\\nIn a BOM you have a header item, usually an item category group LUMF. This would \\npromote a standard item category of, for example, TAP (as seen in Figure 3-15).

The schedule line category is determined based upon the item category and the \\nMRP (materials requirements planning) type on the material master record of the item. It is possible for items with a schedule line to not be relevant for a delivery . Figure 3-17 depicts a basic overview of the standard functions of a few schedule line categories.\\nDefining Schedule Line Category\\nKeeping to our basic sales flow, we will look at the integration of the schedule line category into the following document flow: TA (order) ‡ LF (delivery) ‡ F2 (billing).\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution  | Sales | \\nSales Documents | Schedule Lines | Define Schedule Line Categories [VOV6]\\nRepresented in the IMG (IMG-Implementation Guide) are only two assignments: First, \\nto create or define the schedule line category, as seen in Figure 3-18, and second, to assign it.

It has an \\nalphanumeric two-digit key as well as a short description.\\nAs seen in Figure 3-18, the business data section of the schedule line category defines \\nthe following:\\n• Whether a delivery block is automatically created for this schedule line category, (remember a delivery block can be set as automatic for any of the following):\\n• Sales document type\\n• Schedule line category\\n• Delivery type\\n• Shipping activity, such as picking and goods issueFIGURE 3-17 Schedule line category behavior control\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, a movement of stock between plants has a movement type which is different from the movement of stock for a customer sale, which in turn is different from the movement type for receipt of stock for a customer return. This field indicates which SAP inventory movement to use for schedule line category CP . CP is assigned to item category TAN, which is a standard item category representative of a material to be sold to a customer. The goods movement is a movement from our stock as a sale to our customer. It would be correct to leave this field blank for items for which no stock movement happens. Likewise, should this schedule line be assigned to a return item category, you should ensure the movement type here is relevant for returns, such as a goods receipt.\\n• The movement type 1-step is used when two goods movements need to happen for a schedule line category—for example, in a stock transfer (the issue of stock fr om \\none plant and another movement for the receipt of the stock into another plant).\\n• The order type is the assignment of the purchase requisition type to the schedule line, which allows the system to automatically create a purchase requisition for this schedule line category. This is used for third-party sales—for example, if the customer places the order with you, but you need to buy the material from your supplier for delivery to the customer. The system can automatically create the purchase requisition to purchase the material from the supplier.FIGURE 3-18 Deﬁne schedule line category\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, if you create a new sales order document type ZZOR, made with reference from the standard document type OR, the system will automatically copy all item categories and schedule line categories that were previously assigned to OR and assign them as relevant to ZZOR. Similarly, when you copy item categories and schedule line categories, the system will copy the copy control rules at the same time (if you indicated that you want to copy them).\\nBy selecting the document type we would like to configure or change, \\nand then clicking the Details button, as shown here, we are able to view the configuration for the header transfer of data.\\nCopying rules are set up at the header level for sales, delivery, and \\nbilling documents. They are set up at item level for sales, delivery, and billing documents. However, they are only set up at schedule line level for sales document types. This is because you don’t have schedule lines in deliveries or invoices.\\nSales Document to Sales Document\\nIn Figure 3-21, we see the header copy control rules for sales document to sales document.\\n• We have the source document type OR and the target document type OR.\\n• The copying requirements are rules or certain criteria that must be met before the copy can take place.

Document flow is always useful between related documents—such as from a quote to an order to a delivery to an invoice. It may not be relevant when you use copying purely for data entry reasons—for example, when you copy an existing order into a new order because the customer wants to repeat the order.\\n If you previously used an update document flow value of X (standard document \\nflow) and you wish to change to a 2, you can use program SDVBFA21 to delete unnecessary records to improve system performance. (Note: This will delete the records from VBFA as well.)\\n• The do not copy batch checkbox is self-explanatory. Check this box if you do not want the system to copy the batch number of the material into the following document.\\n• The configuration option is used for the item category representing the main item of a configurable product. If this checkbox is checked the configuration of the source item is copied into the new sales document item.\\n (A configurable product is a basic product that can be configured by the customer to \\ntheir specific requirements. For example, when you buy a car, the car is the basic product. You can choose the color, whether there is a sunroof, a tow bar, etc. These are the configuration options.)\\n• The reexplode structure/free goods checkbox is used when you wish the system to redetermine the bill of materials in the sales document. The system does not copy the actual BOM from one sales document into another but copies the main material and then reexplodes the BOM into its components. The table entries for copying item category TAE to TAE are no longer required and are ignored if they exist.\\n• The positive/negative qty option is used for document flow if you have specified the completion indicator on the item category. You can leave this field blank when copying from a sales order to another sales order. But for copying from a quote or a contract to a sales order, you may want to reduce the open quantity on the quote or contract when an order is created.\\n• Copy quantity is best left blank. This forces the system to copy the quantity of the field best suited for the document type being referenced. You can force the target or order quantity to be used.\\n• The pricing type is an extremely important field. It is worthwhile keeping this entry in mind when creating your pricing condition types. As a rule of thumb, you should have all item categories for a particular sales document with the same settings. Generally, you may use pricing type B (carry out new pricing), G (copy pricing elements unchanged and redetermine taxes), or C (copy manual pricing elements and redetermine the others).\\nWhen using condition B all manual pricing condition types are lost.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The schedule line data is not copied into the delivery because the delivery item is a result of the schedule line and actually “replaces” the schedule line. For example, suppose you have an order item for 100 units and have two schedule lines—one this week for 20 items and one next week for 80 items. When you create the delivery this week, the delivery item is created for the 20 items. So the delivery item is a combination of the order item data and the schedule line dates and quantities.\\nThus all the schedule line data has been used to create and form the basis of the delivery \\ndocument.\\nSales Document to Billing Document\\nThe same data is required when copying from a sales document into a billing document or from a delivery document into a billing document. Using the delivery document to billing document as an example, as shown in Figure 3-26, we can see the following:\\n• We have the source document type LF and the target document type F2.\\n• The copying requirements are rules or certain criteria that must be met before the copy can take place. This example has the copying requirements set at 003 with the description “Header/dlv.-related.” (Refer to requirements and formulas in Chapter 8.)

However, \\nthe sales document types we will focus on are the standard process most commonly used in SAP Sales and Distribution. These documents encompass their own business process procedures. The document flows we will look at are the following: the quotation; special sales orders such as the cash sale process and rush order process; the credit and debit cycle; as well as the returns and invoice correction request process, which is a combination of the credit and debit document. We will also look at contracts and scheduling agreements.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Sales  | \\nSales Documents  | Sales Document Header  | Define Sales Document T ypes [VOV8]\\nIn the following document types, instead of repeating each field, I have simply listed the \\nsettings that should be allocated to that document and the reason why they should be chosen.\\nThe Quotation\\n(Sales document type AG (QT in English))\\nThe quotation is a sales document type that comes before the sales order and after an \\ninquiry. It is used as a proposed agreement of a price and quantity for a particular material or service for a particular date. Most quotations have a validity date.\\nThe quotation can have pricing and schedule lines. It can have output assigned and \\ncredit checks assigned.\\nThe quotation is useful in business processes to determine if the material will be available \\nat the right time for the customer at the right price. Should the quotation be satisfactory it may be copied into a sales order. Depending on the customizing entries, you can copy the pricing elements and the header data, as well as the item, material, and order quantities into the sales order.\\nEnsure your quotation has sales document category B for quotations. I recommend you \\nset all document types relevant to read the customer material information record so set the indicator to “read info record.” The screen sequence group can be set at AG, which is SAP standard for quotations. The transaction group should be set as 2.\\nIt is also recommended you set a value for the quotation messages option. This will read \\nthe item level or header level to indicate to the user when he is cr eating a new quotation \\nthat an open quotation already exists for the customer if set at header level, or an open quotation already exists for the customer and material if set at item level.\\nDo not forget to set the item category determination and schedule line category \\ndetermination as well as the copy control rules—for example, from a quotation to a sales order.\\nThe standard item category used in quotations is AGN.\\nOrder Probability When a sales inquiry or quotation is created you may want to know what \\nthe probability is that the customer will follow through with a purchase.\\nThe system uses an order probability percentage from the customer master record and \\ncombines it with the order probability percentage of the sales document type. The combination of the two percentages results in an order probability percentage and refers to the likelihood that the quote will become an order.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The system automatically proposes the current date in the sales order as \\nthe date for the delivery and billing.\\nOnce the sales order is saved, the system then creates a delivery automatically and \\nprints out a cash sale invoice, which may be given to the Sold-to Party . This cash sale \\ninvoice is a paper form created via output determination (see Chapter 9).\\nThe delivery can be relevant for picking. (See Chapter 6 for more information on the \\ndelivery and picking process.) Or if the goods are not to be picked (if, for example, the sold to party already has them), then the delivery can be marked not relevant for picking and the goods issue can happen automatically in the background so that the invoice can be created.\\nNote the billing can occur in the standard process. Also there is no accounts receivable \\npostings from the billing document as the customer has already settled the invoice. Instead the invoice amount is posted directly to a cash account.\\nThe Rush Order Process\\n(Sales document type SO)\\nFor the rush order process the customer places the order and collects the items immediately , \\nor the materials are shipped immediately. However, the customer is invoiced later.\\nThe system automatically creates a delivery when the sales order is saved. However, no \\ninvoice is printed; instead the system follows the standard procedures for creating the billing document (that is, the invoice is created once the delivery has been goods issued).\\nBoth the rush order process and the cash sale process utilize the shipping conditions \\npassed on from the sales document. The shipping conditions in turn are used to determine the shipping point and the route.\\nThe only difference between a rush order and a standard order is that the rush order has \\nan immediate delivery creation. This delivery, however, may still need to progress through the logistics process of picking, packing, loading, and goods issue processing.\\nThe Credit Process\\n(Sales document type G2)\\nThere are two types of credit procedures. In the first the customer returns previously \\npurchased products and requires a credit. This we will look at later in this chapter in “The Returns Process.” The second general form of credit procedure is when the customer is credited without returning any goods. This would be used in the following examples:\\nThe customer discovers the products that were sent him are defective and the costs to \\ninitiate a return delivery would exceed the costs obtained in rehabilitation or repair of the product. Thus, the customer is instructed to scrap the material and is subsequently issued a credit note. There is no return.\\nThe second scenario is when the customer is overcharged for a product or service and is \\nissued a credit for the difference. Again, there is no movement of material.\\nYou can automatically set a billing block that may be released by an authorized person \\nprior to the billing (credit) being carried out. It is the billing (the credit note) that credits the customer’s account in accounts receivable.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

You should also ensure the document flow checkbox is checked in the copy control rules to ensure you have a history.\\nIt is also possible to make it mandatory to enter an order reason on the credit note, \\nwhich can explain why the credit was given.\\nThe standard item category used by credit memos is G2N.You may not wish to credit the customer for everything on the invoice. For example, \\nyou may not wish to give a credit for the entire freight charge. In this case you can have a new returns pricing procedure that is similar to the standard pricing procedure you use but not have the freight condition type. The conditions are copied over, excluding freight. In this new pricing procedure you can also have an additional manual condition type. (Refer to pricing in Chapter 8.)\\nThe Debit Process\\n(Sales document type L2)\\nThe debit process is used when a customer is undercharged for a material or service. A \\ndebit memo request is created and invoiced using standard billing procedures. There is no movement of material.\\nYou can automatically set a billing block that may be released by an authorized person \\nprior to the billing being carried out. This is not too commonly used because we are increasing the customer’s accounts receivable, so there is no fraud risk as there is with the credit process. The billing is the actual creation of the debit note from the debit memo request.\\nYou may set a mandatory indicator that the debit memo request can only be created with \\nreference to the invoice document that originated with the problem. Also, activate the document flow checkbox on the copy control rules in order to retain the document flow history .\\nIt is also possible to select an order reason on the debit note, and make this field mandatory \\nin the document type incompletion procedure.\\nDisputed amounts usually arise from incorrect pricing master data. So rather than debiting \\nthe customer for the disputed amount, it is recommended that you credit the customer for the disputed sales document in full, then correct the pricing and create another standard debit that will use the correct pricing with the correct amounts. This procedure can be followed for all disputed short priced orders (and the reverse can be used for overpriced orders).\\nStandard SAP will not allow the creation of inter-company invoices for order-related \\nbilling documents. Instead see OSS note 63459. The basic concept of this OSS note is that you need to assign an output type (ZZIV) to the external invoice (the customer ’s credit or \\ndebit) at the header level. This output type then needs to be activated via a r un of the print \\npr\\nogram RSNAST00 and the inter-company credit or debit will be created. This process is \\nwell supported by SAP and you should not worry about its implementation.\\nThe standard item category used by debits is L2N.\\nThe Returns Process\\n(Sales document type RE)\\nThe returns process is different from the standard credit process in that a return delivery is \\nmade. While we cannot assume to map all the functionality you may require in the physical process, such as goods receipt and warehouse management movement, we will look at the basic flow of the returns order procedure.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

By using the same pricing values you ensure a complete reversal of the invoice.\\nDo not forget to activate the update document flow checkbox on the copy control rules, \\nbetween billing (invoice) and sales document (return).\\nIt is advisable to have a billing block assigned to the return order in the sales document \\nheader configuration to initiate a billing block automatically, in order to prevent a credit for returns being created until an authorized person releases the billing block.\\nOnce the returns delivery is created and goods receipted, the material is receipted back \\ninto the plant. The material should use a goods movement that receives the stock into blocked stock. Once the blocked stock has been inspected, you can either scrap it or r ework \\nit if the stock is faulty; or, if the stock is saleable, you can put it into unrestricted use stock. The stock is then available for the next sales order.\\nIt is advisable to indicate a shipping condition that is specifically used for r eturns; thus, \\nall return deliveries or goods receipts may be done by a specific shipping point. (See shipping point determination in Chapter 6.) This is useful when r unning the delivery due \\nlist. You can select only to process the returns deliveries, as well as offer better visibility of stock movements.\\nThe standard item category used by returns is REN.After the creation and goods issue of the delivery, the billing block is removed from the \\nsales order and the invoice is created, with reference to the sales order. This way you are able to create a credit for the return in the sales order, which in turn has the order quantity copied from the preceding invoice. The credit memo then automatically reduces the customer’s accounts receivable balance.\\nSAP creates the billing document from the returns order rather than from the delivery \\nso that the customer can receive the credit without waiting for the goods receipt to take place if, for example, it may take a while for the stock to be r eturned to the plant, but the \\ncustomer wants the credit immediately.\\nInvoice Correction Request\\n(Sales document type RK)\\nThis document proposes a new way of processing complaints and issuing credit and \\ndebit memos. The document allows you to correct the quantity and or the price for one or more faulty items on an invoice.\\nEach invoice correction request is made in reference to an (mandatory) invoice. (You \\ncannot create one in reference to an order or quotation.) Each invoice correction request contains two items for each item in the invoice. The first item is the value and quantity copied from the invoice; this appears as the credit item. The second item is the debit item, which represents the correct quantity and or value.

This means that:\\n• It does not create a requirement for stock within the plant and subsequently there is \\nno confirmation of stock within the plant for the contract.\\n• It does not require production to make the stock to satisfy the contract.\\n• It does not require material management to purchase the stock to satisfy the contract (if it is a trading good).\\nThe requirement is placed on the plant when the release order is created with reference to \\nthe quantity contract. The contract itself has no schedule lines. It does have a validity date.\\nThe contract allows the customer to have a special price per material for a limited \\nquantity. This quantity decreases each time an order is made by the stock ordered.\\nOnce the contract validity date expires or the customer has purchased the full quota of \\nstock, the contract expires, and a new one must be created.\\nQuantity contracts have no schedule lines or specific delivery dates, as they are not \\ndelivered. An order from a contract is called a release order ; the delivery is done from the \\nrelease order.\\nFor example, a contract is made with a quantity of 1,000 items. Then each order the \\ncustomer places with reference to this contract will decrease the available quantity of this contract. So if the customer places an order for 100 units, the open contract quantity becomes 900 units.\\nNote that this only applies if you have set the Update Document Flow checkbox as \\nenabled on the item category in the copy control rules. If this is not set, the customer can order as much as he would like, without regard to the contract quantity being updated.\\nQuantity contracts can be used to limit the customer’s purchasing; you can block the \\nstandard order type for a customer and so force him to use an order type that must be created with reference to a quantity contract. Thus, this customer is limited to only ordering 1,000 items.\\nA quantity contract has validity periods and can have cancellation rules.To create a contract, use the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Sales and Distribution | Sales | Contract | [V A41] - Create\\nTo make a release order, simply create a standard sales document with reference to the \\ncontract.

However, they do not replace the price procedure used in the contract. The standard price procedure determination is used. Instead, the values in these fields are used for supplemental price agreements.\\n• The contract profile is discussed in detail in the next section.\\n• The billing request is used for service contracts, to bill the customer for a service that was not agreed to in the original service agreement. The standard SAP sales document type to perform this billing is LV , which is a debit memo request for service contracts.\\n• The group reference procedure is used for master contracts to determine which data is to be copied, or proposed, into lower level contracts. The referencing procedures are configured with master contracts later in this chapter.\\nFIGURE 4-3 Contract settings on Deﬁne Sales Document Types screen\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This field indicates to \\nthe system what to do when data differs between the header and item levels. With the setting as an X, the system will not copy any changes you make in the header level into the item levels. This is also true even if the data at header and line item were identical prior to the header data being changed. With the setting as Y, the system automatically copies all header data into the item in the contract (only if the header and item contract data were identical prior to the changes).\\n• The follow-up activity type is used to speed up the creation of follow-up activities. For example, the follow-up sales activity type 0002 (telephone call) is specified for sales document type WV (service contract). You create a follow-up activity work list for contracts in Sales Support (CAS) and maintain the selection criteria as r equir ed. \\nThis is maintained in the following menu path.\\nMenu Path Sales Support (CAS) | SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and \\nDistribution | Sales Support (CAS) | Sales Activities\\n• Should the follow up action have been “create quotation,” you would need to enter a quotation document type, in the field subsequent order type. Then when you select from within the list of contracts when you select Sales Document | Create Subsequent Order, the system will propose the order type you entered in this field.\\n• The update lower level contracts field need not be initiated, as the contract in question is not a master contract. This field is used by the system to update lower -\\nlevel contracts, should the data you are changing be the master contract. These changes are then passed down to the lower-level contracts via workflow. Should this field not be set, the system will only update the lower-level contract when it is re-processed.\\n• The check partner authorization field checks that the partner either is the Sold-to Party of the contract or has a partner function of AA (which indicates an authorized release partner). This is the standard checking rule A. Alternatively, in the standard checking rule B, the system then checks if the partner wishing to release from the contract is a lower level customer in the customer hierarchy, to the Sold-to Party in the contract.\\nYou may also create multiple Ship-to Parties for the specific contract. The standard Ship-to Party partner function is WE (German translation). However, you may have more than one Ship-to Party; thus, you may assign Ship-to Parties with the partner function AW\\n .\\nAssign both the release Sold-to Parties and the release Ship-to Parties to the Sold-to Party \\nof the contract in the customer master record.

In the pr evious example the baseline  \\ndate is equal to the billing date. The time period is the value that will later be multiplied by the time unit; in this example the unit is 3, which is equal to “month.” The calendar ID is the key for the factory calendar. The factory calendar takes into account non-working days and public holidays, so the resultant date may be later when calculated using a factory calendar, the importance of which is often undervalued. See “Factory Calendars” in Chapter 6.\\nSet the contract data checkbox to force the system to always use header contract data to \\ndetermine the baseline date, as opposed to the item or header data dependent on the usage of the date rule.\\nDefining Validity Period Categories\\nTo define validity period categories, use the following menu path.\\nFIGURE 4-4 Contract proﬁle\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Within that period of one week, the contract may then be cancelled on any day up to the last day of the one-week period. (The notice value is 1 and the unit is day, therefore the contract may be cancelled up to one day before the end of the week.)\\nThe system uses these settings to automatically enter the validity period and date \\ndetermination in the contract. This is done by assigning the contract profile to the sales document type representing the contract, for example, WV.\\nService and Maintenance Contract Process\\nThe service contract is a legal agreement between the receiver of the service and the business supplying the service. It is used by the business, for example, to initiate automatic billing of routine services at regular intervals and can determine if a cancellation request of the contract is valid. It is used by the receiver of the service as a contract he can claim on, with easy access to requests for service and set prices on specific services.\\nThe standard SAP Sales document type for a service contract is WV .Generally, a service contract need not have call off or release orders, nor does it need to \\nbe created with reference to other sales documents.\\nFor a service and maintenance contract no delivery is necessary because the transaction \\ndoes not involve the movement of materials.\\nThe service contract may have periodic or milestone billing (see Chapter 7) and bill the \\ncustomer according to a schedule of billing dates.FIGURE 4-7 Cancellation procedure validityCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

None of the contracts have a schedule line level. Thus, neither of these contracts are responsible for delivering products. Each of the value contracts has a release order, which calls off from the total value.\\nThe release orders are standard order types created with reference to the contract. The \\nSold-to Party must correspond to that of the value contract being called from, or it must be  a release partner. This is also true for the Ship-to Party.\\nThe value contracts WK1 and WK2 have their own number range. Try to keep all \\ncontract number ranges equal for ease of use later. They both have the sales document category G (contract).\\nThey both have a pricing procedure assigned to them.

Thus the master contract has the general data that is relevant for all lower-level contracts over a specified period.\\nContracts are grouped in order to ensure all data in the lower-level contracts remains \\nconsistent as well as ensuring terms granted in the master contract ar e copied into all lower-\\nlevel contracts.\\nThe documents that can be gr\\nouped under a master contract are\\n• Quantity contracts\\n• Value contracts\\n• Service contracts\\nA master contract contains header data only: The billing plan data, the partners data, \\nbusiness data, and contract data.\\nTo understand and configure a master contract, it is important to understand what the \\nbusiness wants from contract grouping. Contract grouping is the process whereby several lower-level contracts are linked to one master contract to ensure data consistency. When you link a lower-level contract to a master contract the header data of the master contract is passed down into the lower-level contract.\\nFor this to happen the lower-level contract and the higher-level contract must be assigned \\nto the same sales area. Note that you may not assign a hierarchy of contracts together. You may only have one master contract with many lower-level contracts assigned to it.\\nTo group contracts, you must first determine the referencing requirements.

Select Copy All, from the pop-up dialog box to copy all subsequent entries. It is always recommended to copy all subsequent entries and to delete the entries not required afterwards.\\nAs you are familiar with tables and field names from Chapter 1, you can use the \\ntransaction code [SE12] to read the short text of the field entries of a certain table, or [SE11] to read the table and all its fields with descriptions.

Column 3 is a partner function column—for example, the Ship-to Party . \\n(Refer to “Partner Determination” in Chapter 2.) Column 5 indicates if the system is to give a message to a lower-level contract each time it wants to update this lower-level contract with data from a master contract.\\nColumn 4 has the copy rules assigned to it. These copy rules are as follows:\\nA Indicates the contract must have the same value in the field for the higher- and lower-level contract. Should these fields not match, that is, if you change the value in the field of the lower-level contract, the reference will no longer be carried out. Thus the contracts will not be allowed to be linked.\\nB Indicates the value in the field is to be copied from the master contract and cannot be changed in the lower-level contract. Thus, fields deviating in the lower-level contract are not allowed.\\nC Indicates proposal fields. This occurs when the master contract copies or proposes the data into the lower-level contract.

For example, the split rule SD2 adds up to 100, causing 15 percent of the schedule line quantity to be delivered on Mondays, 30 percent on Tuesdays, and so on.\\nColumn H defines the holiday rule for the delivery schedule split.

This is done on an agreement that the customer will sell or consume as many of these materials as he can. Only after he has consumed any or sold any and informed the business will the business transfer the stock to the customer’s ownership and issue an invoice. Should the customer not wish to sell or consume any more material, he informs the business and they take the stock back.\\nAll requirements transferred from consignment sales orders to materials planning are \\ntransferred as individual requirements. This occurs regardless of what the availability checking group setting is on the respective material master record.\\nConsignment stock is monitored in the system by customer and material and the \\nconsignment quantity is controlled separately from the available stock for standard sales orders. This type of stock is referred to as special stock. Another form of special stock is returnable packaging.\\nThe Consignment Fill-Up\\nWhen the business delivers stock to a customer on consignment, it is called consignment  \\nfill-up .

(Refer to Chapter 3.)The big changes to the standard sales order process are due to the customer not being \\nbilled for any of these items. So no invoice is relevant. Thus the sales document type setting for order-related billing and delivery-related billing should be configured as not relevant for billing documents.\\nThe item category used as standard for consignment fill-ups, KBN, should be set as not \\nrelevant for billing as well as for no pricing. Thus the business data of the item category should look similar to Figure 4-23.\\nThe item does allow schedule lines. This is a fundamental element in the consignment \\nprocess. The schedule line category determines how deliveries are to perform and what types of goods movements are carried out. The standard schedule line categories to be used are E0 and E1.\\nSchedule line category E1, as shown in Figure 4-24, is to be used with MRP . It uses \\navailability checking.\\nThe schedule line states the item is relevant for deliveries and when the delivery \\nhappens the item must use movement type 631, which, at the time of goods issue, posts the stock into a special consignment category in the delivering plant’s stock for that customer and material.

This document type is relevant for billing. It should be relevant for delivery-related billing using a standard delivery type F2.\\nThe standard item category used is KEN. Item category KEN is relevant for billing as \\nwell as pricing. It has schedule lines and should determine the cost of the item.\\nThe item category has a special stock indicator that is used to indicate that the material \\nbeing controlled must be controlled as special stock. For consignment, the special stock indicator used is a W.\\nThe standard schedule line categories used are C0 and C1. Schedule line category C1 \\ndoes an availability check and materials requirements planning. The movement type associated with the transaction checks for available consignment stock at the consignee’s site. The schedule line is relevant for deliveries.\\nTo create a consignment issue order, use the same menu path, but select sales document \\ntype KE. Proceed through the delivery and the invoice.\\nOnce stock has been consumed from the customer’s consignment stock (that is, the \\ndelivery has been made and the goods issue posted), the stock overview [MMBE] scr een \\nwill represent this transaction by showing a lower quantity in the customer consignment stock for that material.\\nThe Consignment Returns\\nThis process should not be confused with the pick-up of the materials. The consignment returns is a sales process flow that represents faulty materials or product consumed or sold by the consignee, who puts the stock back into his consignment stock as faulty and r equests \\na credit note for returns.\\nYou may wonder why the material is simply not returned into the plant stock. While it \\nis possible, and can be configured, generally, a customer manages his own stock and balances, and returns stock back into consignment stock.\\nThe sales document type is KR and has a sales document type category H, which \\nindicates a sales return document. The return should also have a different number range  for visibility of returned items.\\nThe returns document type should also promote a special shipping condition that will \\ncause a special shipping point to be used in shipping point determination (discussed in Chapter 6) and can be used to process all return deliveries.\\nI would suggest all return order document types be restricted to having a mandatory \\nreference procedure. Thus, I would assign an M, indicating a reference to a billing document. Do not forget to assign the reference document in the copying control rules and make sure you select update document flow in the copying control rules. This will ensure visibility of the path through consumption of the stock to return of the stock.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This will \\nrestrict all consignment pick-ups from being made unless they make reference to a fill-up order type. You can restrict the reference to being mandatory to an order type, thus setting C, and then further control the referencing procedure by using the copying control rules. Again, ensure in the copying control rules that you indicate to report a document flow.\\nAs the stock is coming back into the warehouse or plant, you will want a specific returns \\nshipping point to be automatically determined, so assign the special shipping conditions you use to determine this. Refer to “Shipping Point Determination” in Chapter 6.\\nNo invoice is necessary, as the goods are not changing ownership. The materials are still in \\nthe possession of the business, and remain in possession of the business until the act of goods issue in the consignment issue process. Goods issue is the trigger that transfers ownership from the business to the consignment consumer.\\nThe standard item category for consignment pick-ups is KAN.The standard schedule line categories of the consignment pick-up process are F0 and F1. \\nSchedule line category F1 is relevant for delivery as well as transfer of requirements and availability check.\\nDo not forget the availability check is done against the consignment stock on the \\ncustomer’s site.

Material determination uses the condition technique to substitute one material in the sales order for another when certain conditions are met.\\nMaterial determination is triggered by the material entered in the line item of the sales \\norder. This material may be used to automatically exchange one of the business’ products for another during certain periods—for example, Christmas time—using a specially wrapped product. Or it may be used to exchange a customer-specific part number for one of the businesses part numbers. Material determination may also use a dialog box with a number of products that the user may select from.\\nAn Introduction to the Condition Technique\\nMaterial determination is also useful for substituting an old product that is to become obsolete or a new product that is to be released by your company at a specific date. Material determination can automatically swap the old product for the newer product at the time of the sales order creation, based on a validity date.\\nMaterial determination is sometimes referred to as product selection and can be automatic \\nor manual. This is useful, for example, when the customer may not want the specially wrapped product at Christmas, but would prefer the standard product.\\nThe configuration options available for material determination ar e\\n• Blank value Automatic substitution – Item will be replaced\\n• A Substitute products are displayed for selection\\n• B General material determination with selection, without ATP\\n155CHAPTER\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For the purpose of this example we will \\ncopy the standard condition type A001.\\nYou need not have a validity date here, as it is better to constrict your entries with \\nvalidity dates when you create your condition records later.\\nThe access sequence is assigned to the condition type.\\nDefining Access Sequence\\nThe access sequence must exist before you can assign it to a condition type. In this example access sequence A001 is assigned to condition type A001.\\nAn access sequence is a sequence of steps that the system follows in sequential or der to \\nobtain a condition record. The condition record has a value that is assigned to it.\\nThe access number is the order in which the system will read the access sequence. The \\nsystem will run through each step of the access sequence in sequential order until it finds an exact match for the defined table. If a record exists for that table, the system will come back with the data; if no record exists or no match is found, the result will be that no condition record exists for this condition type.\\nFor example, if we had access numbers 10, 20, 30, and 40, the system will start with the \\nlowest entry, which is 10. It will then try and process everything assigned to the step 10. Should it not be able to process the line, it will then proceed to access 20, and so on.

However, when using the customer - \\nmaterial information record you may only enter the customer’s material in the Customer Material field of the sales order. Should you be using material determination to indicate automatic swapping of the customer number automatically one to one, be car eful not to use \\nthe customer material information record, as this may confuse the user as to where he should enter the data.\\nThe automatic substitution that happens in the background only occurs according to \\nthe availability check (if you select as a sub-item). Suppose you have four pr oducts for the \\nsystem to do an automatic substitution on, and you have stock of one of them but not the other three. The system will propose and consume that one for which you have stock. This can cause problems, because if this one material is procured correctly, due to there being a demand for it, it may automatically fill up, causing a continual cycle where only this material is ever used and the other three are not consumed.\\nThe Outcome column allows you to select whether the proposed item from material \\ndetermination should automatically replace the existing material or if it should be displayed as a sub-item in the sales order. \\nRemember, if you use the outcome sub-items be sure to configure your item category \\ndetermination correctly. That is, the main item that is being substituted should have the usage indicator PSHP (product selection higher level item) and the sub-item material that is being displayed as a sub-item should have the usage indicator PSEL.\\nOnly one schedule line is proposed by the system for the line item for which automatic \\nsubstitution occurs when the item is a represented as a sub-item.\\nLastly, when using a one-to-one automatic swapping of materials, the material entered \\ndoes not need to be created in the system.

The schedule line represents the customer’s requested delivery date and quantity to be delivered. This information is transferred (transfer of requirements) to materials requirements planning (MRP). MRP is then able to determine if there is enough quantity of stock available for the scheduled delivery date. The transfer of requirements aims to ensure that the materials ordered are ready for the requested delivery date.FIGURE 5-16 Create a condition record for A001.\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Thus transfer of requirements must be closely configured in association with the respective logistics teams.\\nTo configure transfer of requirements, use the following menu path. \\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Sales and Distribution | Basic \\nFunctions | Availability Check and Transfer of Requirements | Transfer of Requirements\\nAs described earlier, the schedule lines in the sales order transfer the requirements \\nthrough to MRP . You are able to select for which documents you would like the transfer of requirements to happen. For example, you may not wish any transfer of requirements to happen for quotations. However, you may want the transfer of requirements to happen for standard sales orders.\\nIndividual or Collective Requirements\\nThe transfer of requirements can either be a transfer of requirements with an individual requirement or a transfer of requirements with collective requirements. This is set in the Availability check field on the material master record in the Sales: General/Plant view. Use transaction code [MM01] - to create a material and transaction code  [MM02] - to change a material master record.. Not only does this control how the availability check is processed, but also how the requirements are transferred to MRP .\\nIndividual requirements  are, as the name implies, an individual transference of demand \\nto MRP for each schedule line. An advantage of this is that the availability overview (transaction code [CO09]) will show the order quantity, the sales document number, the item number, and requirements class (see requirements class later in this section) for each schedule line for which a demand has been created. Often one may refer to the stock requirements list (transaction [MD04]) and view a requirement from a sales document, however with this view it is difficult to see if a requirement has been confirmed, that is stock has been allocated to the requirement. By using the availability overview transaction [CO09] one is able to see the confirmed “allocated” quantity for a requirement. The view of the availability overview is configured using a checking group, please refer to availability control and checking groups, later in this chapter.\\nCollective requirements are a collective grouping of requirements created either daily or \\nweekly and transferred to MRP . The documents created in collective requirement processing cannot be individually identified from the availability overview. Collective requirements are useful to a business that deals with a large volume of sales orders per day, as it allows the business to have a clearer view of the availability overview as well as speeding up response time within the system.\\nTo access the availability overview screen, shown in Figure 5-17, use the following  \\nmenu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Menu | Logistics | Materials Management | Inventory Management | \\nEnvironment | Stock | Availability Overview\\nOne may also use the transaction code [CO09].By clicking on the Total Records button, the overview will display all the documents \\nthat have requirements.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It is based on the \\nrequirements type for the sales document.\\nThese requirements classes are also used in Production Planning (PP), so be sure to \\nintegrate with PP and Materials Management (MM) in any changes you envision in the SD \\nmodule. The requirements type and, eventually, requirements class are determined in the strategy group so all changes made there should also be coordinated through PP .\\nThe strategy group may be found on the material master (transaction code [MM02]) \\nMRP 3 view under planning.\\nFor the transfer of requirements to be carried out, you need to ensure a few criteria are met:\\n• A plant must be assigned to the sales document line item level.\\n• The schedule line category must be switched on for transfer of requirements.• The transfer of requirements must be switched on at the requirements class level.• A checking group must be defined and allocated to the material master record in the \\nSales: General/Plant view in the availability check field.\\nWhen the transfer of requirements is switched on at requirements class level, it can be \\nswitched off at schedule line level. However, you cannot switch on the transfer of \\nrequirements at schedule line level if it is switched off at requirements class level.\\nSettings for the transfer of requirements specific to schedule lines are only relevant for \\nsales documents—for example, the sales order. In the shipping documents, however, the settings for the requirements class apply.\\nThe requirements class is determined from the requirements type of the material.An example of how the transfer of requirements is carried out is seen in Figure 5-18.The customer orders 100 pc for the requested delivery date of 06/01/08. Block A \\nrepresents the availability check, which shows the confirmed quantities at schedule line level. Block B represents the passing on of requirements, which shows the passing on of the demand for 100 pce for 06/01/08.\\nThe result would be the quantities as confirmed in the schedule lines, with an open \\norder quantity of 10 pce, which would be confirmed once stock has been re-entered into the plant, for example. (And MRP (Material Requirements Planning) had been run to re-allocate stock to open order quantities.)\\nConsumption Modes\\nThe consumption mode defines whether, and in which direction on the time axis from the requirements date the consumption of customer requirements with planned independent requirements should occur.

You must also enter \\nthe appropriate strategy group for planning using planning materials on the MRP 3 screen.\\nYou are not able to perform a transfer of requirements from the sales or delivery documents \\nwhen using a planning material. Rather, the actual requirement from the order or delivery consumes the independent requirement of the planning material. The independent requirement is thus reduced. Then when MRP is run, requirements are created for the order or delivery , and for the balance of the independent requirement. For example, with an independent requirement of 100 tons and an order of 20 tons, the order becomes a requirement of 20 tons, and the independent requirement is reduced to 80 tons. The total requirement is still 100 tons.\\nThe Stock Requirements List\\nThe stock requirements list is the central table to planning and stock control.

This purchase order is used to purchase new stock in \\norder to meet the demand on MRP for a particular customer’s sales order.\\nHere you define requirements that must be met in order for the purchase order or \\nassembly order to be created. An example is the standard SAP requirement 101, which will stop a purchase order or assembly order from being created should a credit block exist on the sales order.\\nThis completes the SD module’s aspects of configuring the transfer of requirements. \\nThe transfer of requirements is closely associated with the availability check. They should be planned and configured at the same time.\\nThe transfer of requirements and availability check are closely associated with credit \\nmanagement as well. For example, if a sales order is locked by credit management, all subsequent processing, such as delivery, is supposed to be stopped. For this purpose, the confirmation in the schedule lines is reset.\\nRegarding credit management and standard Transfer of Requirements - the requested \\nschedule line passes a requirement in spite of the credit management, credit control block, however the confirmation of the requirement can be configured to be unconfirmed as in standard. This requirement is also processed from the MRP run and the procurement is triggered. The credit lock does not stop this process. The third-party order processing and the assembly processing is referred to as direct procurement. In both cases, the procurement element is created directly from the sales order (the purchase requisition in the case of the third-party order processing and the production order, planned order, or the like in the case of the assembly processing).\\nThe credit block in the sales order prevents the creation of the procurement element. \\nHowever if the credit block is first set during the change of a sales order, the procurement element is deleted again. As long as the credit block is set in the sales order, no procurement or production occurs for this sales order.\\nIf a sales order is released from the credit block, an availability check is carried out again \\nfor this order. The availability check tries to confirm the requested quantities.\\nIn case of the direct procurement, a purchase requisition or a production order is created \\nagain in the background.\\nIt is possible in some instances that the subsequent operations and pur chase r equisitions \\nthat have been used may not have been deleted. For example, in a service or der, they may \\nhave simply been locked, as all pr\\nocesses should be on hold due to the credit block.\\nWhen the document is released, a new document (for example, a new service order) \\nmay be created to continue the process.

It results in a material availability date. \\nThis represents the date the system has determined the requested material will be available. \\nAdded to this date is the pick pack time, the loading time, and the transportation scheduling time, which may or may not be added, depending on how long it is. All of these dates result in a planned goods issue date, which is the planned date the goods are transferred from the business’ ownership and control, possibly to a shipping agent. The shipping dates are then added to the goods issue date, resulting in a delivery date. This automatically determined delivery date is then communicated to the customer when the sales order is placed.\\nTerminology Used in the Availability Check\\nBackorder processing is the processing of a backorder, which in itself is a sales order that has not been confirmed in full or not confirmed at a certain delivery date.\\nRescheduling is a proposal of how confirmed quantities already assigned to sales orders \\nmay be reassigned to other orders that have a higher priority—for example, an earlier requested delivery date.\\nATP is an acronym for “availability to promise,” which is the basis of the availability \\ncheck. The system is able to automatically calculate the available quantity to pr omise or \\ncommit to a sales document based upon a number of rules that we shall define later.\\nATP takes into account all movements into and out of the warehouse. The stock examined for ATP may be safety stock, stock in transfer, stock in quality \\ninspection, and blocked stock. The planned receipts and planned issues of the stock associated with ATP may be purchase orders, purchase requisitions, planned orders, production orders, reservations, dependent reservations, dependent requirements, sales requirements, and delivery requirements.\\nIf the business produces special stock, such as made-to-order goods or consignment \\nstock, the ATP check may be carried out against the special stock.\\nReplenishment lead time  is the time needed to produce the requested stock. It can comprise \\nthe time taken by the business to produce a material or the time taken to externally procure the material from a vendor. This includes the goods receipting time. Thus the replenishment lead time is the time taken for the material to become available. Replenishment lead time is only used when doing an ATP check.\\nThe value of the replenishment lead time for a material is specified on the material \\nmaster record. It may be determined in one of two ways:\\n• The replenishment lead time for an externally procured material is determined based \\non the total of the processing time for purchasing, the planned delivery time, and the goods receipt processing time. These settings may be made on the Purchasing and MRP 2 views of the material master record.\\n• The replenishment lead time for an internally procured material  is based on the in-house \\nproduction time, seen on the MRP 2 view as well as the goods receipt processing time, or alternatively if set, from the total replenishment lead time, which is found in the material master record on the MRP 3 view.\\nIf a sales order is created and there is no available stock and the ATP check is set to include \\nreplenishment lead time, the system will automatically confirm the desired quantity for the end of replenishment lead time based on whether the material is externally or internally procured.

The control of the availability check is defined by the checking group on the material master record and the checking rule representing the transaction.\\nSchedule Line Category\\nThe availability check may be fine-tuned at the schedule line level, in the same way as the transfer of requirements was carried out at the schedule line level. Those schedule lines that are not relevant for availability check may be switched off at schedule line level by ensuring the availability check indicator is not flagged.\\nDelivery Item Category\\nThe delivery item category can be used to control whether an availability check takes place in deliveries. This setting in the availability check is used to switch the availability check of f \\nin deliveries.\\nRequirements Class\\nThe requirements class as used in the transfer of requirements controls the relevance for planning, requirements planning strategy, and requirements consumption strategy. It is also responsible to determine if an availability check is to be performed for the material on the basis of the ATP quantity and whether the transfer of requirements is passed on.\\nRequirements Type\\nThe requirements type refers to the requirements class and its features. The requirements class is assigned to the requirements type in the transfer of requirements.\\nRequired Data for the Availability Check to Be Utilized\\nIn order for the availability check to be carried out, the following data, in addition to the configuration entries, described later, must be defined in the system:\\n• The availability check must be switched on at requirements class level.

However, in delivery document ATP checks, only the delivery requirements are taken into account, so there is a danger that quantities reserved in the sales documents are considered to be available by the availability check in the deliveries, resulting in the deliveries being created and the material availability dates of the materials in the sales documents being pushed out.\\nDetermining Procedure for Each Delivery Item Category\\nIn this step you switch off the availability check for specific delivery item categories, as seen in Figure 5-33.

This chapter deals with copy control, picking, simple warehouse management processes, and special stock.\\nDelivery Process\\nThe delivery process is a continuation from the sales process. It is generally used in outbound processing to move goods from the plant to the shipping vendor to the customer. However, the returns process of inbound deliveries is also included as a standard SAP delivery process, where instead of “posting goods issue” for outbound deliveries, we “post goods receipt” for an inbound flow of products back into our plant.\\nA delivery document can be created with reference to a sales document such as an order \\nor a scheduling agreement (which was discussed in Chapter 4). Or it may be created, for example, with reference to an inbound return sales document.\\nIn mySAP ERP , the shipping functions have been removed from the Sales and Distribution \\nsection of the SAP Customizing Implementation Guide. Instead, they have been placed in the Logistics Execution section. However, it is critical that the people responsible for the SD module understand this topic.\\nDelivery Document Configuration\\nA delivery document type is similar to the sales order document type. Whereas in the sales process the sales document structure and control were defined largely by the sales document type, in the delivery process the delivery document type controls how the delivery is to function. The structure of the delivery document is very similar to a sales document type in that a delivery document has a header and item structure. The output of an SAP delivery is a goods movement.\\nDefining Delivery Types\\nThe SAP delivery document is usually the step subsequent to a sales document type and preceding a billing document. However, a delivery is not restricted to being created from a sales document type.

Generally, the delivery item category has the same naming convention as the sales document item category fr om which it is \\ndetermined; however, it has its own control features.\\nDefining the Delivery Item Category\\nTo define delivery item categories, use the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide| Logistics Execution| Shipping| \\nDeliveries| Define Item Categories for Deliveries [0VLP]\\nWe will configure these a little later.\\nDefining Delivery Item Category Determination\\nFirst, we need to discover from where the delivery item category is determined. If an order item or a schedule line is copied into a delivery, the item category used in the sales order is also copied. For example, if a TAN item category is used in the sales document type, the system will propose a TAN in the delivery document as well.\\nFor items independent of orders in the delivery (for example, packaging material that is \\nentered in the delivery) or for deliveries that have no reference to a sales document, the item category is determined by the delivery item category determination table.\\nThis item category is determined, as seen in Figure 6-2, by the delivery type plus the \\nitem category group of the material plus the usage of the item plus the item category of the higher level item, similar to the item category determination pr ocedure in the sales or\\n der.\\nTo configure delivery item category determination, use the following menu path. \\nFIGURE 6-2 Delivery item category determination\\nCopyright by SAP AG\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, should you carry out batch determination in the delivery, you are able to assign a delivery item category to an item that has a usage defined as CHSP- batch split. (This will create a delivery line item for each batch, even if the product on the delivery is the same and was represented by a single sales document line item.)\\nDon’t forget you can view the usages of the item category in table TVVWT, which may \\nbe easier than looking at each in configuration individually.\\nDefining a Delivery Item Category Continued\\nThe delivery item category is represented by the following settings as seen in Figure 6-3.\\nThe item category is assigned to a document category; in this case the document \\ncategory is for deliveries, represented as a “J.”\\n• The Material Number 0 Allowed field is used to permit the item to be created \\nwithout having a reference to a material reference. This is used in examples for text items, where one creates a line item with a special item category and types text in the description of the material description.\\n• The statistics group for the item category is used to generate statistics in the logistics \\ninformation system.\\n• The stock determination rule is used in conjunction with the stock determination \\ngroup to determine the stock determination strategy.\\n• The Check Quantity of 0 field specifies whether you can create an item that has a \\nzero quantity and, if you do, how it is to react with a warning or error message or no message at all.\\n• The Check Minimum Quantity field is a check carried out against the minimum \\ndelivery quantity on the material master record and the customer material information record. The response from the system can be a warning or an error message.\\n• It is possible to create an over-delivery , thus the Check Over Delivery indicator is used \\nto display a warning message or an error message should the delivery quantity exceed the limit in the customer material information record or the sales order quantity .\\n• The Availability Check Off indicator allows you to turn off the availability check for \\na delivery item.\\n• The Rounding indicator is used to determine if the system should round up, round \\ndown, or leave the results as they are in cases such as the correlation of multi-level bills of material in the delivery if the non-availability of a particular BOM in another partial BOM were to cause decimal positions. This would only impact you if you were using large numbers with indivisible partial quantities in a BOM.\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This item is then available in the picking list and to be transferr ed to \\nwarehouse management. It would not be advisable to make all items relevant for \\npicking; for example, you would not pick service items such as a technicians hours. Generally, unless you do physical picking from the warehouse, you do not need picking. Picking is therefore not required for non-stock, value, and service items.\\n• The Storage Location Required field indicates a storage location must be entered for \\nthis item before the delivery can be completely processed. Likewise, the Determine Storage Location field is an indicator used by the system to indicate automatic determination of the storage location for the delivery item. The Don’t Check Storage Location field is used to stop the system from checking that the material exists in the storage location that was determined.\\n• The No Batch Check field ensures the system does not check to determine if the \\nbatch entered in the delivery line item exists in the system or not.

A number of companies have a specific emergency shipping point for their delivery due list to create emergency deliveries. A variant is then created for this shipping point and is executed on a much shorter time scale than ordinary delivery document creation.\\nWhen one deals with delivery creation, one must be aware of the fiscal requirements of \\nthe country in which you are operating. Some countries do not permit a sales order to be broken up into more than one delivery, and likewise they may not permit more than one sales document to be combined into one delivery.\\nThe item categories of a delivery are referenced from the sales order; for example, item \\ncategory TAN in the sales order proposes item category TAN in the delivery.\\nThe SAP standard version uses DLN as the standard item category used to represent an \\nitem in a delivery without reference to a sales order.\\nOne is also able to define a delivery split according to specific criteria in the copy control \\nrules. In the formation of the data transfer one may set up splitting criteria. Splitting criteria and the usage of ZUK is covered in “Pricing” later in Chapter 8.\\nOne may execute the delivery due list by using the following transaction codes.

Use the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | \\nBasic Shipping Functions | Shipping Point and Goods Receiving Point Determination | Assign Shipping Points\\nThe shipping point is the location from which a delivery originates. Whether that \\nlocation be a physical or a systemic location, no delivery may be made without a shipping point. The shipping point is determined by the system based on the shipping conditions, which are either entered manually in the sales order or copied from the customer master record. (Shipping conditions may also be copied from the sales document type if not maintained on the customer master.) The loading group, which is copied from the material master record, and the delivering plant of the line item in the sales order are also shipping conditions.

This way, you are able to run the due list every half hour for one shipping point only to create deliveries for that particular plant. Likewise, in the sales order the user knows that if he manually enters a specific express shipping point, he will have the delivery created within half an hour. The remainder of the deliveries may be created via the delivery due list in the normal processing run.\\nConfiguring the Shipping Point Determination\\nTo configure the shipping point determination, use the following steps:\\nDefine Shipping Conditions\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | \\nBasic Shipping Functions | Shipping Point and Goods Receiving Point Determination| Define Shipping Conditions\\nThe shipping conditions are entered in the customer master record in the shipping \\nscreen and in the sales document type.

The shipping conditions may be manually changed in the sales order, or they may be defaulted to a particular sales document type. Should they be defaulted to a particular sales document type, the system will ignore the setting on the customer master record.\\nProceed with copying a shipping condition and changing the name to represent your \\nrequirements, using the prefix Z.

It would not be recommended to use the same shipping point for returns or receiving goods as you do for outgoing deliveries. Thus you may assign all returns sales document types their own returns shipping condition and thus promote a returns shipping point.\\nHaving a returns shipping point allows greater visibility of material movements in the \\nsystem and in the plant, as well as allowing the processing of the delivery due list for returns orders only.\\nDefining Loading Groups\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | \\nBasic Shipping Functions | Shipping Point and Goods Receiving Point Determination| Define Loading Groups\\nDownload at Boykma.Com', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

You may have items such as text items or \\nreturn items that are not picking-relevant. Picking is always carried out from a particular \\nstorage location, so for a delivery to be picking-relevant, a storage location must always be entered. If interfacing with warehouse management, the storage location in the delivery determines which storage location to use in the warehouse.\\nPicking is configured using the following menu path.\\nMenu Path SAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | \\nPicking\\nDefining Relevant Item Categories\\nSAP Customizing Implementation Guide | Logistics Execution | Shipping | Picking| Define Relevant Item Categories\\nHere you indicate to the system which item categories are relevant for picking. This \\nindicator may either be set here, or when defining the delivery item category. Should the item not be relevant for picking, it is not necessary to have a storage location determined for the item either. Thus when creating the delivery item category, you would not need to indicate “determine storage location” or “storage location required.”\\nInterface with Warehouse Management\\nIf you have defined a warehouse in SAP and assigned it to a storage location, and you use this storage location in a delivery, then you must use Warehouse Management to do the picking for that delivery.\\nWarehouse Management is a module in its own right. In this section I’ll introduce you to \\nsimple warehouse management processes.\\nThe process for placing goods in the warehouse is as follows: The goods are received \\ninto the interim storage area for goods receipts (for example, from production). A transfer order is then created in WM to move the goods into the warehouse. This tells the warehouse staff where to put the stock. When the stock is put into the warehouse in the correct place, the transfer order is confirmed, which tells SAP that the goods have been moved out of the interim storage area (i.e., the loading and unloading area) into the warehouse.\\nThe process for extracting the goods from the warehouse is as follows: You can create a \\ntransfer order [LT03] from the delivery, and SAP will choose stock from the warehouse to be \\ndelivered. This choice is based on a number of inventory methods, such as LIFO (last in, \\nfirst out) and FIFO (first in, first out). The transfer order will instruct the warehouse staff \\nwhere to get the stock from, and to deliver it to the interim storage area for goods issues.\\nOnce all the stock has been picked, the transfer order is confirmed [LT12], which \\ninforms the system that the stock has been taken out of the warehouse and made available \\nfor loading in a loading bay or other such place.\\nIf you created the transfer order from a sales delivery, SAP will confirm that the delivery \\nhas been picked when you confirm that you have fulfilled the stock quantity in the transfer \\norder.\\nDuring confirmation of the transfer order [LT12], select Pick Quantity 2. This will result \\nin the system automatically picking and post goods issuing the delivery document.\\nThe order can now be loaded onto the truck, and the goods issued.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This requirement performs in the \\nsame way as all other requirements in the Sales and Distribution module, in that the criteria \\nstipulated must be met in order for packing to be carried out. An example of a requirement here could be that no packing is to be carried out for items that have a credit block.\\nReturnable Packaging\\nNot all packaging materials are inexpensive enough for the cost of the sale to include the cost of the packaging as well. One may have packaging materials that are valuable, and should a customer decide to keep or destroy the packaging items, he should reimburse the business.\\nThus returnable packaging is used in the process whereby the business sells items to \\nthe customer. These items are packed into handling units such as boxes and crates. The customer may then keep the boxes or crates for a certain period, by which time he must have returned the items. Should the customer not have returned the shipping units specified by that set date, or should he have destroyed the shipping units, the business may bill the customer.\\nSpecial Stock\\nThe stock you deliver incorporates packaging materials. This packing is kept at the customer’s location, but will remain the property of your company. The stock is recorded automatically as special stock at the customer’s location.\\nThis special stock may be seen using the stock overview screen using transaction code \\n[MMBE]. Returnable packaging has the stock indicator of V . It is very similar to \\nconsignment stock, which was dealt with in Chapter 4.\\nYou may also view returnable packaging at the customer’s site by selecting SAP Menu | \\nLogistics | Materials Management | Inventory Management | Environment | Consignment |  \\n[MB58] - Consignment at Customer. Then select Returnable Packaging at Customer, as seen \\nin Figure 6-18.\\nThere is no special sales document required to use returnable packaging. However, you \\nshould use the sales order view of a double line entry. This will permit you to view the main item as well as the returnable packing stock item, which may be seen as the lower level item to the item it packs. This is merely for display and traceability in the sales order.

This is very important when sending stock by rail or truck, for example.\\nIt is generally cheaper to send the stock by truck rather than rail if the quantity is small, \\nbut for very large quantities, it is usually cheaper to use rail. For the smaller quantities, determine a route that is defined for road shipments; for large quantities, determine a route that is defined for rail shipments.\\nDefine weight groups with a short meaningful description.

An intra-company sale refers to a transaction within one company code, such as intra-company stock transfers, where stock is moved between two plants within a single company code.\\nCollective Billing and Copy Control for Billing Documents\\nA billing document may be created individually or collectively. We’ll examine how to control billing document creation, keeping in mind the copy control rules and the master data.\\nIntroduction to Collective Billing\\nBilling documents may be created individually. That is, you may create an invoice for each sales order or billing document. Billing documents may also be created as collective billing documents. Invoices can be accumulated and created collectively—for example, on one day of the week, when all relevant data is equal, the system may combine multiple deliveries or sales document into one invoice.\\nThis is done by using a combination of the factory calendar assigned to the payer master \\nrecord and the billing copying rules.\\nTo create collective invoicing for a customer, you must first define the billing factory \\ncalendar the payer is using. (Refer to “Factory Calendars” in Chapter 9.) This factory calendar is then assigned to the billing view of the customer master record for the payer. The billing calendar may indicate one day of the week as a working day, thus the system will only propose to create billing documents for this party once a week.\\nHowever, this does not mean that the deliveries and sales orders will be consolidated into \\none billing document. The copy control may require the invoices to be split (for example, if the payment terms are different). But it does mean that the billing documents will be created on that day. We will look at the splitting criteria a little later in this section.\\nIntroduction to Copy Control for Billing Documents\\nThe copy control for billing documents is split into three overall copy control rules. They define copy rules for header and item levels between sales documents.\\n• Sales document to billing document This is used, for example, for credit memos and debit memos that have no delivery document.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Of these five sales orders, we have created two deliveries due to the fact that the shipping point on one of the sales or ders was dif\\n ferent. \\n(Three sales orders could be on one delivery document and two on the other, or four on one delivery document and one on the other.) Now we have the scenario whereby two deliveries of delivery type LF are to be billed.\\nLooking at the copy control rules from delivery type LF to billing document type F2, as \\nseen in Figure 7-5, we may select the relevant copy control rules.\\nSelect the document types, then click the Details button (the small magnify glass) in the \\ntaskbar. You will see a screen similar to Figure 7-6.\\nThe target and source document types are self-explanatory. The copying requirements \\nassign a number, which in turn is the key to a routine. The routine may be found in transaction code [VOFM] (Menu path: Copying Requirements | Billing Documents). We’ll discuss more about VOFM later. The routine 003, which actually includes LV60A003, is used to check specific blocks and statuses to determine if the billing document may be cr eated. \\nThe blocks and statuses it checks are as follows:\\n• Billing block\\n• Billing status\\n• Goods movement status\\n• Incompletion status for billing header\\n• Overall incompletion status for billing document• POD (proof of delivery) status\\nThe determine export data field is used to redetermine the export control (foreign trade data) \\nautomatically in the billing document. The reference number is passed to accounting.  \\nThe allocation number is similar to the reference number. Both of these numbers may have defaults assigned to them on the billing document type.\\nFor self-billing, the value of this field must be equal to a “C,” meaning the delivery \\nnumber is used as a reference. However, this also means that the delivery number will be passed to accounting as the reference field. The system therefore cannot combine deliveries like in a collective invoice as it does not know what number to use as a reference.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is a field with the ability \\nto hold 40 characters. Generally, the routine allocated to this field uses an internal table in its \\ncalculation called ZUK. A value of a reference field to check is passed in the routine to a portion of the 40-character field. The contents of this 40-character value in field ZUKRI is then compared to the next record to be combined in the billing document. If these two \\nvalues of VBRK-ZUKRI are not equal, the document will not be combined.\\nZUK is a string of 40 characters that is stored on the billing header table (VBRK). \\nTherefore, you cannot check a combination of field values in excess of 40 characters.\\nTo create a splitting rule, proceed to transaction code [VOFM] and select Data Transfer | \\nBilling Documents.
