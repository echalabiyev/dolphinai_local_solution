and Distr\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n7\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaster Data in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nMaster Data in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nSales processing is based on the following basic structures:\\n\\nEvery company is structured in a certain way. In order to work with the SAP System your company structure has to be represented in the system. This is done with the help of various organizational structures.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn sales and distribution, products are sold or sent to business partners or services are performed for them. Data about the products and services as well as about the business partners is the basis for sales processing. Sales processing with the SAP R/3 System requires that the master data has been stored in the system.\\n\\nIn addition to sales and distribution, other departments of the company such as accounting or materials management access the master data. The material master data is stored in a specific structure in order to allow access from these different views.\\n\\nThe processing of business transactions in sales and distribution is based on the master data. In the SAP R/3 System, business transaction are stored in the form of documents. These sales and distribution documents are structured according to certain criteria so that all necessary information in the document is stored in a systematic way.\\n\\n8\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nOrganizational Structures\\n\\nOrganizational Structures\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIn the SAP R/3 System you can use several structures to represent the legal and organizational structure of your company. You can structure from the point of view of accounting, materials management, and sales and distribution. It is possible to combine these structures. The organizational structures form a framework in which all business transactions can be processed.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n9\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in SD\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in SD\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIn the SAP R/3 System you can use several structures to represent the legal and organizational structure of your company. The organizational structures form a framework in which all business transactions can be processed.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nYou link the organizational structures in SD with those in Financial Accounting and Materials Management.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nYou maintain and assign the organizational units in Customizing for the enterprise structure.\\n\\n10\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSales Area\\n\\nSales Area\\n\\nUse\\n\\nSD is organized according to sales organization, distribution channel and division. A combination of these three organizational units forms the sales area.\\n\\nThe following graphic displays these organizational elements.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nSales organization\\n\\n1000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n3000\\n\\nDistribution channel\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\nDivision\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n01\\n\\n02\\n\\n01\\n\\n= Sales area\\n\\nIn sales organization 1000, sales and distribution transactions can be carried out through all distribution channels and for all divisions. In sales organization 2000, products of both division 01 and division 02 are only sold through distribution channel 10. In sales organization 3000, only products of division 01 are sold, and only through distribution channel 10.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nCreating a sales area allows you to exclude certain combinations of the different organizational areas.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n11\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSales organization\\n\\nSales organization\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nThe sales organization is an organizational unit within logistics, that structures the company according to its sales requirements.\\n\\nUse\\n\\nA sales organization is responsible for the sale and distribution of goods and services.\\n\\nIt represents the selling unit as a legal entity. It is responsible for product guarantees and other rights to recourse, for example. Regional subdividing of the market can also be carried out with the help of sales organizations. Each business transaction is processed within a sales organization.\\n\\nThe sales organization must be specified in all sales documents. It is therefore available for all basic functions of SD (such as pricing, availability, etc.).\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nA sales organization can be subdivided into several distribution chains which determine the responsibility for a distribution channel.\\n\\nSeveral divisions can be assigned to a sales organization which is responsible for the materials or services provided.\\n\\nA sales area determines which distribution channel can be used to sell the products from one division in a sales organization.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nEach sales organization is assigned exactly one company code for which you enter all accounting details of the sales organization.\\n\\nA distribution chain can be active for several plants and the plants can be assigned to different company codes. If the sales organization and plant are assigned to different company codes, an internal billing document is sent between the company codes before the sales transactions are entered for accounting purposes.\\n\\n12\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nDistribution channel\\n\\nDistribution channel\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nThe distribution channel represents the channel through which salable materials or services reach customers. Typical distribution channels include wholesale, retail and direct sales.\\n\\nUse\\n\\nWithin a sales organization a customer can be supplied through several distribution channels. In addition, the material master data relevant for sales, such as prices, minimum order quantity, minimum quantity to be delivered and delivering plant, can differ for each sales organization and distribution channel.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nA single distribution channel can be assigned to one or more sales organizations.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n13\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDivision\\n\\nDivision\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nIn the SAP R/3 System you can define a division-specific sales organization. Product groups, i.e. divisions, can be defined for a wide-ranging spectrum of products.\\n\\nFor every division you can make customer-specific agreements on, for example, partial deliveries, pricing and terms of payment. Within a division you can carry out statistical analyses or set up separate marketing procedures.\\n\\n14\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nInternal Organization in SD/Business Development\\n\\nInternal Organization in SD/Business Development\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe organization in Sales is represented by the elements sales office, sales group and salespersons. The following figure displays a sample organization in business development and sales.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nSales office\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nReno\\n\\nSales- group\\n\\n001\\n\\n002\\n\\n003\\n\\n004\\n\\n005\\n\\nSls reps\\n\\nMiller\\n\\nSmith\\n\\nHall\\n\\nMarsh\\n\\nBrown\\n\\nLord\\n\\nLong\\n\\nSales Office\\n\\nGeographical aspects of the organization in business development and sales are defined using the term sales office. A sales office can be considered as a subsidiary. A sales office establishes contact between the firm and the regional market.\\n\\nA branch office of a company in Chicago could be designated as a sales office.\\n\\nSales Group\\n\\nThe staff of a sales office may be subdivided into sales groups. For example, sales groups can be defined for individual divisions.\\n\\nSalespersons\\n\\nYou can maintain personnel master records for sales representatives in your company. In the personnel master record, you assign the salesperson to the sales office and the sales group.\\n\\nYou can also enter the system user name of the sales person. This allows mails to be sent to the salesperson (define the partner function for sales personnel in the sales document).\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n15\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nInternal Organization in SD/Business Development\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nSales offices are assigned to sales areas. If you enter a sales order for a sales office within a certain sales area, the sales office must be assigned to that area.\\n\\nThe sales groups are assigned to the sales offices.\\n\\nThe salespersons are assigned to the sales group and the sales office via the personnel master record.\\n\\n16\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nOrganization in Shipping and Transportation\\n\\nOrganization in Shipping and Transportation\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIndependent organizational entities, such as shipping points, are responsible for scheduling and processing deliveries to customers, as well as replenishment deliveries to your own warehouses.\\n\\nA delivery is always carried out by one shipping point only. The shipping point depends on the following criteria:\\n\\nDelivering plant\\n\\nType of shipping (for example, train, truck)\\n\\nLoading equipment necessary\\n\\nLoading Point\\n\\nShipping points can be subdivided into loading points. For example, ramp 1, ramp 2 and ramp 3 belong to the shipping point Forwarding depot.\\n\\nThe following figure displays a possible organization in shipping.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nShipping points\\n\\nForwarding depot\\n\\nMail depot\\n\\nRail depot\\n\\nLoading pnts\\n\\nRamp 1\\n\\nRamp 2\\n\\nRamp 3\\n\\nTransportation Planning Point\\n\\nThe transportation planning point is an organizational unit in Logistics, responsible for planning and processing transportation activities.\\n\\nIt organizes the responsibilities in a company, e.g. according to shipment type, mode of transport or regional departments.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe shipping point is assigned to a plant.\\n\\nLoading points are assigned to shipping points.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n17\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDepartment and Receiving Point\\n\\nDepartment and Receiving Point\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nDepartments are subdivisions of a ship-to party. These might be, for example, different departments in a store, bays in a distribution center, or areas in a manufacturing plant.\\n\\nDepartments are assigned to receiving points, which in turn are assigned to unloading points. One receiving point may have several departments assigned to it, but each department is assigned to only one receiving point. By knowing a department, you can therefore also determine the receiving point and the unloading point.\\n\\nUsing departments and receiving points enables you to more finely specify the final destination for a shipment or portions of a shipment, thus reducing the time it takes for the goods to become available for the receiver’s use or sale.\\n\\nA pallet load of merchandise is delivered to Bay 1 at a department store (unloading point). The shipment is broken down and delivered to one or more floors (internal receiving points). From there the packages are delivered to one or more departments, such as Housewares, Consumer Electronics, Health & Beauty Aids, or Women’s Dresses.\\n\\nUse\\n\\nSales orders\\n\\nThe receiving point and department are located on the Business Data Detail Shipment screen, either at the header or item level. If the header contains this information, this becomes the default for all items, but you can override it for individual items if you wish. Items in a sales order may have different receiving points and/or departments.\\n\\nPicking lists and delivery notes\\n\\nYou can print the receiving point and department on picking lists and delivery notes. If this information was included in the sales order, then it will automatically be inserted in these other documents; otherwise, you can enter it manually. (However, picking lists and delivery notes are not split by receiving point or department.)\\n\\nBilling documents\\n\\nYou can specify that the department and receiving point are to be printed on billing documents. You can also specify that invoices are to be split by receiving point and department.\\n\\nIn Customizing for Retail (Retail → Central coordination → Sales → Sales order processing → Maintain promotion/receiving point determination per sales document type) you can specify for each type of document whether or not automatic department and receiving point determination is to be done.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nThe department and receiving points are fields in sales orders and delivery notes.\\n\\n18\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nDepartment and Receiving Point\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe system can automatically determine the appropriate department and receiving point for an article. To enable this you must first of all carry out the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nFor external customers: Assign merchandise categories in the customer master\\n\\n\\n\\nFor internal sites (for example, member stores or distribution centers): Assign\\n\\nmerchandise categories in the company master\\n\\nIn either case, you then assign valid departments and receiving points to the customer or site, and a department to each merchandise category. A merchandise category can only have one department.\\n\\nWhen you enter an article on a sales order, for example, the system checks the merchandise category to which the article belongs, then checks the merchandise category information for that site or customer. The system then locates the corresponding department and receiving point for this article.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n19\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in Accounting\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in Accounting A group can be represented in the system using the terms client and company code. Generally, a client represents a group, while a company code represents a company in the sense of an independent accounting unit. Company codes are independent from each other in the legal sense.\\n\\nThe following figure illustrates how the client is subdivided in company codes.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nCompany codes\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0002\\n\\n0003\\n\\n20\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in Material Management\\n\\nOrganizational Structures in Material Management To monitor the stock of material it is necessary to be able to store in the system the locations at which materials are kept. You can do this using the terms plant and storage location. A plant can either be a place of production or a single storage location, or a combination of closely situated storage locations where stock is kept.\\n\\nEvery plant is assigned to a company code. This ensures that stocks and stock values can be managed separately in each company.\\n\\nThe following figure illustrates how the client is subdivided in plants and storage locations.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nPlants\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0002\\n\\n0003\\n\\nStorage locations\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0002\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n21\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nLink to Accounting Structure\\n\\nLink to Accounting Structure By assigning sales organizations and plants you create a link between company codes and sales organizations. A plant, though always linked to one company code, can be assigned to different sales organizations. Within a company code several sales organizations can be active. Business transactions can also be carried out between different company codes.\\n\\nThe following figure displays possible assignments of company codes, sales organizations and plants.\\n\\nClient\\n\\nCompany code 1\\n\\nCompany code 2\\n\\nPlant 1\\n\\nPlant 2\\n\\nPlant 3\\n\\nPlant 4\\n\\nPlant 5\\n\\nSales organization 1\\n\\nSales organization 2\\n\\nSales organization 3\\n\\nPlants 1, 2 and 3 belong to company code 1. Sales organization 1 uses plants 1 and 2. Sales organization 2 uses plants 2 and 3. Sales organizations 1 and 2 can make cross-company sales for goods from plants 4 or 5.\\n\\n22\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nLink to Materials Management Structure\\n\\nLink to Materials Management Structure The plants allowed for sales are determined for each sales organization according to the distribution channel, so that a sales organization can sell goods from several plants. A plant can be assigned to different sales organizations. All of these sales organizations can sell from that plant.\\n\\nYou can differentiate further between the plants belonging to a sales organization from the sales view using the distribution channel. For certain plants within a sales organization, the distribution channel \"sales from plant\" is allowed, but not for others.\\n\\nThe following figure shows an assignment of sales organizations and plants.\\n\\nSales organization 1000 sells goods from plants 1000 and 2000. Sales organizations 2000 and 3000 only sell goods from plant 2000 and 3000 respectively.\\n\\nSales organization\\n\\n1000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n3000\\n\\nPlants\\n\\n1000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n3000\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n23\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCustomers and Business Partners\\n\\nCustomers and Business Partners\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nA company deals with different natural and legal persons during business transactions. A customer orders goods from a company. A forwarding agent might deliver goods to the customer. An employee within the company processes the business transactions. All roles a natural or legal person can assume are represented by business partners in the SAP R/3 System.\\n\\nBusiness partners\\n\\nA company has contact with its business partners, who are customers and vendors. Data on each of these and on the company\\'s personnel is stored in a separate master record.\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nThe term “customer” is used to define all customers to whom the company has contact. The term “vendor” is used to define all business partners who carry out a delivery or a service for the company. A business partner can be a customer and a vendor at the same time if, for example, your customer also supplies goods to you. In this case, both a customer master record and a vendor master record must be created for the business partner. You can create a link between the master records by entering the vendor number in the customer master record and the customer number in the vendor master record.\\n\\nVendors\\n\\nData on business partners who are vendors, for example, forwarding agents, is managed in the vendor master record. If a vendor is also a customer, a link can be created.\\n\\nPersonnel\\n\\nData on employees of your own company, for example, sales personnel or clerical staff, is managed in the personnel master record. Data on each employee can be managed by his or her personnel number.\\n\\nOnly the personnel department of your company is authorized to create a personnel master record, using Human Resources (HR). The personnel department of your company manages the personnel numbers of the employees. If HR is not used in your company you can also create a personnel master record yourself for employees in sales and distribution.\\n\\n24\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nWorking with Customer Master Records\\n\\nWorking with Customer Master Records\\n\\nUse\\n\\nYou create a customer master record for customers with whom your company has business contacts. This master record contains all data necessary for processing the business transactions. Maintaining the master data correctly can greatly reduce the work needed to process transactions. This is because the master data is automatically copied into the transactions.\\n\\nHow the Customer Master Record is Structured\\n\\nBoth the accounting department and the sales and distribution department have access to the customer master record. In order to avoid data redundancy, the data for both departments is stored in a common master record.\\n\\nGeneral data, company code data, and sales and distribution data is stored separately in the customer master record. Company code data depends on the company code organization. It is defined individually for each company code. Sales and distribution data depends on the organization in the sales area. It is defined individually for each sales area. General data is independent from company code and sales area. It applies to one customer in all company codes and sales areas.\\n\\nThe following figure displays the structure of a customer master record.\\n\\nGeneral data\\n\\nSD-specific data\\n\\nCompany code\\n\\ndata\\n\\nData in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nDifferent data is maintained in each of the three areas:\\n\\nGeneral data is maintained for every customer. Such as address, communication, etc. This data is identifiable only via the customer number, not via the number of the company code or the sales area. Maintaining the data is possible from both the accounting view and the sales and distribution view.\\n\\nCompany code data is only of interest for the accounting department. It includes, for example, information on insurance or account management. This data applies to only one company code.\\n\\nSales and distribution data is only of interest for the sales and distribution department. It includes, for example, data on pricing or shipping. This data only applies to one sales area, and therefore is dependent on the sales structure (sales organization, distribution channel, division).\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n25\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nWorking with Customer Master Records\\n\\n26\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nPartners in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nPartners in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIn sales and distribution there are:\\n\\nBusiness partners\\n\\nA customer master record must be created for business partners.\\n\\nContact Persons with the Business Partner\\n\\nData on contact persons is stored in the customer master record of the respective business partner. A separate master record for contact persons is not created. A new number is assigned to each contact person within a customer master record.\\n\\nBusiness partners\\n\\nA business partner can be a natural or legal person who is directly involved in a business transaction with you. The following partner functions are defined in the system:\\n\\nSold-to party\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nPayer\\n\\nBill-to party\\n\\nSold-to party\\n\\nFor the sold-to party, data on sales is necessary (for example, the assignment to a sales office or to a valid price list).\\n\\nIn most cases, the company which places an order for the delivery of goods or the rendering of services is at the same time ship-to party, payer and bill-to party. For this reason in the SAP R/3 System the function sold-to party includes all these other functions.\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nFor the ship-to party only data required for shipping is necessary (for example, unloading point and goods receiving hours).\\n\\nPayer\\n\\nA payer is a company or person who settles the invoices for delivered goods or rendered services. For the payer data on billing schedules and bank data is necessary.\\n\\nBill-to party\\n\\nFor the bill-to party you need the address, data on output and possibly data on electronic communication.\\n\\nContact Persons with the Business Partner\\n\\nIn your customer\\'s company there are always one or more contact persons with whom you are in contact either by phone, in writing or personally to carry out business transactions. Often, the information you need about the contact persons is not the same as the information you need\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n27\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPartners in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nabout the customer. The most important data of the contact person is name, telephone number, and department. Since the contact person is part of the customer\\'s company, you enter this data in the respective customer master record. Thus, you do not need a separate master record for contact persons.\\n\\nHowever, in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System you can only enter the data on the contact person in the customer master record of the sold-to party, since only contact persons from this master record are proposed for selection in the sales order.\\n\\nDividing Partner Functions\\n\\nThe company or person who places an order is often the same company or person who receives both the goods and the invoice, and also pays. In this case the customer fulfills all predefined functions. It is also quite common, however, that subsidiaries place orders, and the head office settles the respective invoices. In this case the partner functions are divided among different companies.\\n\\nIf a customer fulfills all functions at the same time, only one master record is necessary, in which all data required for these functions is entered. In this case you create a master record for the sold-to party.\\n\\nIf the functions are divided among different companies, a corresponding number of master records is needed. In one master record you enter, for example, the address of the sold-to party for correspondence, in another one the address of the ship-to party for the delivery. Only in the customer master record of the sold-to party is a link between the individual partners established, and this is done by entering the customer number of the respective partners.\\n\\nScreen and Field Selection for Partner Functions\\n\\nWhen you enter a customer master record for the ship-to party, you need special data for shipping (for example, the unloading point and goods receiving hours). In this case, data on sales or billing is not necessary, providing the ship-to party is not the payer and sold-to party at the same time.\\n\\nYou can limit the screens and fields accessed in the customer master record so that only the necessary data is entered. You do this using account groups. The function of a customer is defined by assigning an account group.\\n\\n28\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nAccount Groups\\n\\nAccount Groups\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe account group ensures that for the different partner functions of a customer only the necessary screens and fields are displayed for input. In the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, if you create a customer master record for a ship-to party, for example, an account group is automatically proposed.\\n\\nThe account group also controls which partner functions the customer can trasnfer into a document. You can see more information under Assigning the Account Group to Partner Functions [Page 171]\\n\\nThe account group then determines the number for the customer master record. For further information on number assignments for customer master records, see Number Assignment for Customer Master Records [Page 34].\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nThere are, for example, account groups for the following SD partner functions in the standard SAP R/3 system.\\n\\nSold-to party\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nPayer\\n\\nSales prospect\\n\\nOne-time customer (CPD - conto pro diverse).\\n\\nYou candefine your own account groups, if your company has other variations, for example, if a ship-to party pays for the goods at the same time.\\n\\nYou can change a customer account group at a later date. For further information, see Changing An Account Group [Page 52]\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nDefine account groups\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n29\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nHow the Customer Master Record is Structured\\n\\nHow the Customer Master Record is Structured\\n\\nUse\\n\\nData on customers is important for both the accounting department and the sales and distribution department. In order to avoid data redundancy, accounting data and sales and distribution data is stored in one master record, the customer master record.\\n\\nA customer master record can be accessed using three different groups of data, which differ in the level of detail they offer. A master record has the following structure.\\n\\nGeneral data\\n\\nCompany code\\n\\nSales and\\n\\ndata\\n\\nDistribution data\\n\\nGeneral data\\n\\nGeneral data does not depend on the company code, or on your company\\'s organization of sales and distribution. Data on a customer is the same in both views. This includes, for example, the customer name, address and telephone number.\\n\\nHowever, general data is not limited to the information which is of importance to both departments. The unloading point, for example, which is regarded as general data, is only relevant for sales and distribution. However, since it is not based on the sales and distribution organization of your company and is always unique for this customer, it is not considered part of the sales and distribution data.\\n\\nIf you edit a customer master record using only the customer number, without specifying a sales and distribution area or a company code, the system will only display the general data screens.\\n\\nGeneral data is entered by the department which first creates the customer master record for a customer. If the sales and distribution department creates the customer master record, it must also enter the address data. When the accounting department enters accounting data it is then unnecessary for them to enter the general data also. They can use the display function to access the general data.\\n\\nCompany Code Data\\n\\nThis data is only of importance to the accounting department. It includes, for example, data on insurance and account management. Company code data only applies to one company code.\\n\\nIf you edit the customer master record you must specify customer number and company code in order to access the screens containing company code data.\\n\\n30\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nHow the Customer Master Record is Structured\\n\\nSales and Distribution Data\\n\\nThis data is only of importance to sales and distribution. It includes data on pricing, delivery priority and shipping conditions. The data for one customer can differ for each sales area. The sales area is a combination of sales organization, distribution channel and division.\\n\\nOnly after entering the sales and distribution data for a customer can you process sales and distribution transactions for the customer (for example, a sales order). Also, you can only invoice a business transaction if the data on the payer has been maintained from the financial accounting view.\\n\\nIf you edit the customer master record you must enter the customer number and the sales area in order to access screens containing sales and distribution data.\\n\\nMenu Access According to the Department\\n\\nIn the system you can access department-specific data via menus:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to define customer data for sales you access the customer master record through the sales and distribution menu (Logistics).\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to enter data for the accounting department, you access the customer master record through the accounting menu.\\n\\nYou can use both initial menus to edit the customer data centrally, i.e. from both the sales view and the accounting view.\\n\\nIn sales and distribution, central maintenance is only provided for the business partners sold-to party and payer, for which central maintenance is worthwhile.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n31\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nData in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nData in the Customer Master Record\\n\\nUse\\n\\nA customer master record contains all data needed for business transactions and correspondence with the customer.

You can use this number to access the master record again later, or to refer to the customer when carrying out business transactions.\\n\\nInternal and External Number Assignment\\n\\nThe number for the customer master record can either be assigned internally by the system, or you can define the number yourself. The second method is called external number assignment. In the case of external number assignment, a number range that allows for alphanumerical number assignment can be defined.\\n\\nThe account group determines whether internal or external number assignment is allowed for a customer master record. For account groups 0001 to 0005, for example, only internal number assignment is allowed in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.\\n\\nNumber Range\\n\\nFor every account group a number range is defined from which a serial number is assigned during internal number assignment. In the case of external number assignment the system checks whether the customer number entered lies within the defined number range.\\n\\nA number range can be valid for different account groups. In the standard version of the SAP R/3 System the account groups for sold-to party, ship-to party, payer and bill-to party belong to the same number range so that the numbers for these master records are assigned consecutively. You can use the number range to assign, for example, different numbers to the head office and the branches.\\n\\nA customer\\'s number is unique for all sales areas and company codes. If you, for example, have created a customer master record for a customer in a sales area and create another customer master record for the same customer in another sales area, the system identifies the number and does not display the general data from the first master record for maintenance, since the general data exists already. You can also use the change and display functions to access the general data of the newly maintained views.\\n\\n34\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nOne-time Customer\\n\\nOne-time Customer\\n\\nUse\\n\\nWith some customers your company has long-lasting business relationships. You have special price agreements with these customers and deliveries are given preferential treatment. At the end of the fiscal year you might honor the reliability of these customers with rebate payments. With other customers you might have only one contact. In the SAP R/3 System you can distinguish between:\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nOne-time customers\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nYou create a customer master record for every customer. In the standard version of the SAP R/3 System you can choose between the partner functions sold-to party, ship-to party, bill-to party, and payer. For further information on partner functions, see \"Partners in the Customer Master Record\".\\n\\nOne-time Customer\\n\\nCustomers who only enter into a business transaction with you once are called one-time customers in the SAP R/3 System. It is not necessary to create a customer master record for these customers, since there remains no need for this master record after the business transaction has been carried out, and it would only require unnecessary storage space.\\n\\nCollective Master Records for One-time Customers\\n\\nYou create a collective master record for all one-time customers. A collective master record refers to a dummy customer and includes only the data that is identical for a certain group of customers.\\n\\nYou can create, for example, a collective master record for all customers of a certain region. This master record would include fields such as a name to identify the master record, the language, the currency and the sales office processing the customer data. If a one-time customer from this region orders goods from your company you will use the customer number of your collective master record when processing the sales order. Only in the sales order itself will you enter the address and all other data not given in the master record.\\n\\nScreens and Fields for One-time Customers\\n\\nWhen you create a customer master record for a one-time customer, the account group CPD (account group for one-time customers) is automatically proposed. This ensures that the screens from different areas (sold-to party, ship-to party, bill-to party, payer) relevant for one-time customers, are accessed. However, only fields which can be identical for all one-time customers are displayed. For example, all address fields are suppressed, since the master record is collective for data of several customers.\\n\\nOn the following screens you can enter a limited amount of data in a master record for one-time customers:\\n\\nAddress\\n\\nSales\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n35\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOne-time Customer\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nBilling document\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nThe account group can restrict the number of screens accessed in the master record for one-time customers even further. If only some of the screens and fields for one-time customers are relevant for your company, ask your system administrator to change the account group CPD or to set up a new account group.\\n\\nFor further information on creating a customer master record for a one-time customer, see Creating a Customer Master Record [Page 40].\\n\\n36\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\nUse\\n\\nA consumer is a natural person for whom you create a customer master record and a master record as a central business partner. In an operative transaction, only the customer data are of any significance.\\n\\nConsumer maintenance allows you to enter all the data on a single screen. If you are working with a consumer, then reference data (known as the reference customer) must be available for creating the master data and processing sales. The consumer data at company code and sales area level are copied from the reference customer.\\n\\nYou can create the following general information for a consumer:\\n\\nPersonal data (e.g. name and gender)\\n\\nAddress\\n\\nBanking details\\n\\nPayment cards\\n\\nReference Customer\\n\\nYou can create a maximum of one reference customer per client. You must maintain all the required sales area and company code segments when creating the reference customer (for this reason, a consumer cannot be a reference customer).\\n\\nThe function for creating master data uses the company code data in the reference customer as a template for creating a consumer master record. In the operative business transaction, e.g. in the sales order, the SD-specific data are required and procured dynamically.\\n\\nConsumer Master Data\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nCentral business partner data, address data and customer data are maintained for the consumer in the system. When you create the consumer, the customer data (e.g. address, bank data and payment card information) is automatically copied from central address/business data or from reference segments. The company code data is copied from the reference customer and created automatically. This allows you to use consumers in operative transactions in the same way as for customers.\\n\\nMaintenance\\n\\nYou maintain the consumer in a single transaction. Select Logistics → Sales and distribution → Master data and then Business partners → Consumers\\n\\nThe maintenance transactions that you use here are designed for processing central business partners and allow you to maintain the consumer data. All consumer data, other than the blocking indicator, can only be processed via these transactions. You have to process the block indicators in customer maintenance.\\n\\nWhen you create a consumer, you may have to enter a consumer number. This number depends on the settings made for the consumer account group (0170 for external or internal number\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n37\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\nassignment). The number of the central business partner is grayed out and is supplied in the background via internal number assignment.

When you have finished entering data, check your data and save.\\n\\nProcessing the Operative Business Transaction\\n\\nDocument Entry\\n\\nNo data is entered at sales area level for a consumer. The sales area-relevant data required during document entry is procured from the master data of the reference customer.\\n\\nPartner Determination\\n\\nThe partner functions in the reference customer are evaluated. The functions sold-to party, payer, bill-to party and ship-to party are not copied from the reference customer, because they are already taken by the consumer.\\n\\nThe reference customer can be used to determine partner functions such as forwarding agent or employee responsible.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYou have to set output determination for consumer processing using the condition technique (i.e. the print proposal does not originate in the master data).\\n\\n38\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nMaintaining the Customer Master Records\\n\\nMaintaining the Customer Master Records\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe following sections describe how you maintain the customer master record.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n39\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCreating a Customer Master Record\\n\\nCreating a Customer Master Record You create a customer master record when you start a business relationship with a new customer.

For example, if your customer base includes multi-level buying groups, cooperatives, or chains of retail outlets, you can create hierarchies to reflect the structure of these groups. You use customer hierarchies in order and billing document processing for partner and pricing determination (including rebate determination) and for creating statistics.\\n\\nYou can use customer hierarchies to assign price conditions and rebate agreements to one of the customer’s subordinate levels, to ensure that all subordinate levels are valid for the customer. For each node that you indicate as relevant for pricing, you can create condition records for pricing. If one or more nodes in a hierarchy path for a sales order contain pricing data, this is automatically taken into account in pricing.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nYou can also use customer hierarchies for evaluations in profitability analysis (CO-PA) and in the Sales Information System (SIS):\\n\\nTo evaluate customer hierarchies with the sales information system and in the profitability analysis, you can maintain the field Hierarchy assignment on the Marketing tab page in the customer master record for a hierarchy customer. Here you can maintain 10 features for hierarchy customers (HIEZU01 to HIEZU10). You can use these to evaluate hierarchies statistically with up to 10 levels. (Field catalogue VHIE)\\n\\nNote that the hierarchy assignment is statistical. If you change the customer hierarchy, you may need to change the hierarchy level manually in the customer master record in the Hierarchy assignment field.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nA customer hierarchy is a flexible structure consisting of customers. Each customer - with the exception of the uppermost customer - refers to another customer at a higher level in the hierarchy (known as a higher-level customer). Customers that are assigned to higher-level customers are known as dependent customers.\\n\\nTo be able to display organizational elements, that are not independent partners, you can assign pure hierarchy nodes (account group 0012) in the hierarchy. Specific data can be assigned to a hierarchy node (for example, address, price conditions, rebate agreements) and this then applies to all subordinate customers.\\n\\nAs all nodes in a hierarchy are time-dependent, you can adapt the customer hierarchy to changes in the structure of a customer at any time.\\n\\nCustomers can be reassigned in a hierarchy When reassigning a customer, all subordinate customers are moved with it\\n\\nYou can add new customers to a hierarchy When you assign a new customer to an existing hierarchy, all pricing data, that applies to the higher-level hierarchy node, is automatically copied from the customer\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n55\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nCustomer Hierarchies\\n\\nYou can also remove customers from the hierarchy\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\nCustomer Hierarchies and Pricing\\n\\n56\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nCustomer Hierarchy Type\\n\\nCustomer Hierarchy Type\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nYou can use the customer hierarchy type to determine the following:\\n\\n\\n\\nthe purpose of a specific hierarchy (for example, pricing, statistics)\\n\\nwhich account groups are permitted in the hierarchy\\n\\nwhich organizational data is permitted in the hierarchy\\n\\nUse\\n\\nWhen you maintain a hierarchy, enter the corresponding hierarchy type.\\n\\nCustomer hierarchy type A is provided in the standard system (standard hierarchy).

In a master record for this account group you can specify specific data that is only required for one node in a customer hierarchy, that does not take on any active role in order processing such as sold-to party, goods recipient etc.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nThe account group settings for the customer hierarchy can be made in Customizing for Sales and Distribution under Master data → Business partner → Customer → Customer hierarchy → Assign account groups.\\n\\nIf required, you can change the account group for a customer in the customer hierarchy, for example, you can assign the account group Sold-to party to a customer with account group Customer hierarchy nodes, that cannot issue orders, so that he can issue orders.

For example, a customer advises you that the buying structure of his organization will change, effective the beginning of next year. You want to restructure the customer hierarchy in advance.\\n\\nYou maintain the hierarchy, changing the assignment of nodes as necessary and entering the valid-from date that corresponds to the change at the customer. Until that time the existing node assignments continue to function as before. In addition, you can also specify a valid-to date for a node. If you leave the valid-to date blank, the system automatically proposes 12/31/9999.\\n\\nYou may want to define a temporary reassignment for a node for which you have already defined a future change. The following example shows how the system re-establishes the validity period in this case. There are two assignments for node 4712: a current assignment and a future assignment that becomes valid on the 01.01. 1995.

You create master records for each customer, that you want to use in the hierarchy.\\n\\nDepending on the function the customers have in the hierarchy and in order processing, create master records for Customer hierarchy nodes or for the sold-to party, payer and so on. You can find further information in Creating Customer Master Records.\\n\\nIn the customer master record you can indicate whether the customer is relevant for pricing, rebate processing, profitability analysis (CO-PA) or evaluations in the sales information system (SIS).\\n\\n2. You create a hierarchy, in which you assign the hierarchy customers for the higher-level customer.\\n\\nNormally the sold-to party or goods recipient are assigned to the lowest hierarchy level. You can, however, also assign a sold-to party to a node, that is at a higher level. For example, you could assign a particularly large branch of a chain of retail outlets to the regional office instead of to the local office.\\n\\n3.

All information necessary for the management of a material and its stocks, as well as its use, is maintained in the so-called material master record. This includes, for example, data on purchasing, on sales and on storage.\\n\\nDifferent company areas and SAP modules access the material master records, which therefore must meet a wide variety of requirements. During sales processing, the system repeatedly accesses the material master records. It is one of the basic sources of data for sales processing. The material master record is accessed, for example, in the inquiry, in the quotation and in the sales order. Data in the material master record is also of great importance for shipping and billing. However, the data required for shipping, for example, is not the same as that required for sales or billing.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n79\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaterial Types\\n\\nMaterial Types\\n\\nUse\\n\\nMaterial types in the SAP standard version are, for example, raw materials, trading goods, semi- finished products, finished products, or services. The material type represents certain features of materials in the system, and has important control functions: the material type is used, among other things, to group field selection functions for a material, or to define the screen sequence, the type of number assignment and number ranges during material master record maintenance. Depending on the material type, company areas maintain different data screens. This screen selection applying specifically to an application is called a \"view\".\\n\\nThe following are examples of possible material types in the SAP standard version:\\n\\nTrading Goods\\n\\nNon-stock Material\\n\\nServices\\n\\nPackaging Material\\n\\nTrading Goods\\n\\nTrading goods are movable goods intended for commercial exchange. Examples of trading goods are market goods, consumption goods and durable goods. Trading goods are always bought and re-sold by your company. The material master record for trading goods therefore always contains purchasing data and sales data. Trading goods are managed in the SAP R/3 System using the key HAWA.\\n\\nNon-stock Material\\n\\nNon-stock material includes materials that are not managed on an inventory basis (for example, small parts such as nails) though physically in stock. Non-stock materials are managed in the SAP System using the key NLAG.\\n\\nServices\\n\\nServices are represented and managed in the SAP System as materials. Services are immaterial goods that differ from other goods, particularly in that their production and consumption coincide. Services are generally regarded as non-transportable and non-stockable. Typical services are commercial services, transport services, bank and insurance services, goods from cultural organizations and the mass media, as well as services provided by the public security forces or the education and health sectors.\\n\\nSince services cannot be stored, a material master record of this material type does not contain inventory data or inventory management data. No fields for gross weight, net weight or unit of weight are included in the basic data for a service, as are for other material types. Services are managed in the SAP R/3 System with the key DIEN.\\n\\nPackaging Material\\n\\nThis material type includes all materials needed for packaging. For example, boxes or crates. Packaging materials are managed in the SAP R/3 System with the key VERP.\\n\\n80\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nMaterial Types\\n\\nOther Material\\n\\nMaterials which cannot be assigned to any of the standard material types, can be maintained, as \"Other material\". Thus, besides standard material types (trading goods, finished products, services etc.) you can also create additional material types. When creating such a material, note that a material type must be entered on the first data screen. For standard material types, this entry is not necessary because the material type is selected in the menu.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n81\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nIndustry Sectors\\n\\nIndustry Sectors Industry sectors indicate the assignment of a material to a certain branch of industry (for example, plant engineering and construction, chemical industry, mechanical engineering, and pharmaceuticals industry).\\n\\nUse\\n\\nLike the material type, the industry key also has important control functions. It determines, for example, the selection of data fields on screens or the screen sequence. The subdivision into different industry sectors is necessary because, for example, a material in the chemical industry, such as a chemical solution, differs from a material in mechanical engineering in its basic characteristics.\\n\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, the following industry sectors have been defined for the material master record:\\n\\nIndustry Sectors in the Standard Version of the SAP R/3 System:\\n\\nIndustry key Industry sector\\n\\nA\\n\\nPlant engineering and construction\\n\\nC\\n\\nChemical\\n\\nM\\n\\nMechanical engineering\\n\\nP\\n\\nPharmaceutical\\n\\n82\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nOrganizational Structure of the Material Master Record\\n\\nOrganizational Structure of the Material Master Record\\n\\nUse\\n\\nEach company has a specific structure and a typical organization. This is represented in the SAP R/3 System as an organizational structure. A certain part of the organizational structure is relevant for every company area.\\n\\nOrganizational Levels\\n\\nAn organizational structure consists of several organizational levels. These are used by different company areas. The organizational levels sales organization and distribution channel are, for example, used exclusively by sales and distribution while plant and storage location are shared by sales and distribution and materials management.\\n\\nThe sales and distribution data for a material is managed at the organizational levels client, plant, sales organization and distribution channel. Therefore, you have to enter the plant, the sales organization and the distribution channel for which you want to change a material master record.\\n\\nIf a material which is available both in plant 1 and plant 2 is to be changed in plant 1, enter only that plant number. You then only get the plant data for this material in plant 1. If you only enter the sales organization and the distribution channel, then you get the sales-specific data without plant data.\\n\\nUsing the organizational level distribution channel, you can, for example, sell materials with different conditions. The prices agreed for distribution channel wholesale trade, for example, are not the same as those for distribution channel retail sales.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n83\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nData Structure of the Material Master Record\\n\\nData Structure of the Material Master Record\\n\\nUse\\n\\nAll data and information entered for a material is stored in the data structure of the material master record. For sales and distribution, general data and sales and distribution data in the material master record are relevant.\\n\\nGeneral data\\n\\nGeneral data in a material master record is identical for every sales organization, plant and storage location. General data, which is of importance for all departments, is always entered by the department which creates the first part or view of the master record. General data contains, for example, the material number that identifies it, the material description, units of measure, value, weight, volume and divisions.\\n\\nSales and Distribution Data\\n\\nSales and distribution data in a material master record is defined for a specific sales organization and distribution channel. The delivering plant, the assignment to the sales group, grouping terms for price agreements and sales texts, for example, are included in sales and distribution data. The fact that a material is linked to a distribution channel allows the material to be sold with different conditions through the various distribution channels.\\n\\nSales and distribution data is divided into data that depends on the sales organization and data that depends on the plant:\\n\\nSales organization/distribution channel data\\n\\nThis data includes the delivering plant, the sales unit, the minimum order quantity and the minimum delivery quantity.\\n\\nPlant data\\n\\nThis data applies to a plant and all its storage locations. Examples of plant data are MRP data, such as the safety stock quantity, the reorder level, or the shipping processing time.\\n\\n84\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nMaintenance Status in the Material Master Record\\n\\nMaintenance Status in the Material Master Record\\n\\nUse\\n\\nEvery material master record has a maintenance status that indicates the department-specific view from which a master record is maintained.\\n\\nThe maintenance status is automatically updated and managed by the system.\\n\\nAs soon as a material master record, is maintained, for example, by sales and distribution, the indicator in the maintenance status is automatically set to V. If it is also maintained by purchasing, the system adds E to the maintenance status indicator. The same material master record can be maintained, for example, by sales and distribution and by purchasing, but not by accounting. The master record then would have the maintenance status V and E but not B (accounting).\\n\\nYou can display which departments have not yet maintained a material master record. For further information on this, see Maintaining a Material Master Record [Page 98].\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n85\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSales and Distribution Screens in the Material Master Record\\n\\nSales and Distribution Screens in the Material Master Record Four screens in the material master record are relevant for sales and distribution:\\n\\nSales 1\\n\\nSales 2\\n\\nSales/Plant Data\\n\\nTexts in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe following overview includes a short description of the individual sales and distribution screens, and lists the important data fields found on these screens.\\n\\nSales and distribution screens Description and important data fields\\n\\nSales 1\\n\\nBasic data and units of measure (e.g. sales units, order quantities)\\n\\nSales 2\\n\\nMaterial groupings and tax classification (e.g. product hierarchy, material pricing group)\\n\\nSales/Plant Data\\n\\nSales and shipping data (e.g. gross weight, loading group)\\n\\nTexts in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nSingle-line or multi-line texts for sales documents, in several languages\\n\\n86\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nGrouping Materials\\n\\nGrouping Materials\\n\\nUse\\n\\nMaterials can be grouped according to different criteria. This allows for easier management and better evaluation of materials with similar features. The standard version of the SAP R/3 System does not provide exact criteria to differentiate between individual groupings. These result from company-specific applications. The materials can therefore be grouped by the company to meet their specific demands. The groupings are determined and defined by the system administrator. Contact him, if you have questions concerning the existing groupings.\\n\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 System the following groupings are possible, for example:\\n\\nMaterial Group\\n\\nMaterial Pricing Group\\n\\nProduct Hierarchy\\n\\nMaterial Group\\n\\nGoods with the same features (for example, nails) can be grouped using the field Material group. Unlike the product hierarchy, the material group does not contain different levels or possible combinations of goods. You can, however, use the material group to carry out different analysis functions.\\n\\nThe material group is defined by a nine-digit, alphanumeric key. It is not primarily of importance for sales and distribution, but is used mainly in materials management.\\n\\nMaterial Pricing Group\\n\\nA further option for grouping materials is represented by the material pricing group. This can be used both for pricing as well as for evaluation and analysis. The material pricing group is defined by a two-digit, numeric key.\\n\\nProduct Hierarchy\\n\\nThe product hierarchy is used to group materials by combining different features. It is used for analyses and pricing. A product hierarchy can consist of up to eighteen characters. Its features can be combined in various ways. The following figure gives an example of how materials can be grouped using product hierarchies.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n87\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nGrouping Materials\\n\\nPosition 1-5\\n\\nElectrical appliances 00001\\n\\nSpare parts 00002\\n\\nPosition 6-10\\n\\nDry appliances 00001\\n\\nWet appliances 00002\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\nPosition 11-18\\n\\nElectrical stoves 00000001\\n\\nFood processors 00000002\\n\\nWashing machines 00000001\\n\\nDish- washers 00000002\\n\\n.....\\n\\n.....\\n\\n.....\\n\\nIn this case, a dishwasher can be described by product hierarchy 00010000200000002. This series of characters states that dishwashers belong to the category electrical appliances (series of characters 00001, position 1-5), and also to wet appliances (series of characters 00002, position 6-10) and, finally, to dishwashers (series of characters 00000002, position 11-18).\\n\\n88\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nUnits of Measure and Quantity Specifications\\n\\nUnits of Measure and Quantity Specifications\\n\\nUnits of Measure\\n\\nA material can be stored, transported and sold in various units of measure. In the SAP R/3 System, you can therefore define various units of measure which are maintained in the sales and distribution screens. However, you only need to maintain the fields of the units of measure if they deviate from the base unit of measure. If no other fields with units of measure are maintained, the system automatically takes the base unit of measure as a basis for its calculations. You can enter the following units of measure in the sales and distribution screens:\\n\\nBase Unit of Measure\\n\\nAlternative Unit of Measure\\n\\nSales Unit\\n\\nDelivery Unit\\n\\nBase Unit of Measure\\n\\nStocks of a material are managed in the base unit of measure. All quantity movements in other units of measure are converted automatically by the system into the base unit of measure.\\n\\nAlternative Unit of Measure\\n\\nAs soon as units of measures other than the base unit of measure are used in a material master record, the system prompts you in a dialog box to enter a calculation factor to the base unit of measure, the so-called alternative unit of measure. The alternative unit of measure does not refer to an entry field in one of the sales and distribution screens. It is either requested in a dialog box or entered on a secondary screen, which you can access by pressing F5 (Unit of measure). Several alternative units of measure can be defined.\\n\\nIf, for example, a product is managed in the base unit of measure \"Piece\" but is sold in the sales unit \"Box\", you must define the conversion factor. The alternative unit of measure can define, for example, that 1 box of this material contains 12 pieces.\\n\\nSales Unit\\n\\nThe unit of measure in which materials are sold is referred to as a sales unit (for example, piece or bottle). The value you define in the material master record is proposed during business transactions relevant for sales, such as the sales order. You can replace them with other alternative units of measure in the sales order.\\n\\nDelivery Unit\\n\\nThe delivery unit refers to the unit in which materials can be delivered. Only exact multiples of the delivery unit can be delivered. For example, with a delivery unit of 30 bottles, 30, 60 or 90 bottles can be delivered, but not 100 bottles.\\n\\nQuantity Specifications\\n\\nTwo different quantity specifications are used:\\n\\nMinimum Order Quantity\\n\\nMinimum Delivery Quantity\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n89\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nUnits of Measure and Quantity Specifications\\n\\nMinimum Order Quantity\\n\\nThe minimum order quantity refers to the minimum quantity the customer must order. A warning message appears if the minimum order quantity is not reached during order entry. The order can be entered in spite of the warning message.\\n\\nMinimum Delivery Quantity\\n\\nThe minimum delivery quantity refers to the minimum quantity you must deliver to the customer. The minimum delivery quantity is automatically checked during delivery processing. A warning message appears during delivery processing if you enter a delivery quantity lower than the minimum delivery quantity. The delivery can be created in spite of this warning message.\\n\\n90\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nDelivering Plants\\n\\nDelivering Plants The delivering plant refers to the plant from which the goods are to be delivered to the customer, within a specific sales organization and distribution channel. The plant can be automatically proposed by the system when processing a sales order, if it has been maintained in one of the master records. It can be derived from:\\n\\n\\n\\nthe customer/product info record\\n\\n\\n\\nthe customer master record of the ship-to party\\n\\n\\n\\nthe material master record.\\n\\nThe order of priority is as in the list above.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n91\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nItem Category Groups\\n\\nItem Category Groups\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe item category group determines how a material is processed in the sales order. It defines, for example, that pricing does not take place for a free of charge item, such as a business gift; or that inventory management is not carried out for a service. When processing sales and distribution documents, the system uses the item category group to determine the item category. The system determines the item category based on the item category group of the material and the current business transaction, and proposes it in the respective document.\\n\\nWhen creating the material types non-stock material and services, DIEN is proposed in both cases for the item category group, because the order processing for both material types is identical: for example, pricing is carried out for both, but no availability check.\\n\\n92\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nNumber Assignment for Material Master Records\\n\\nNumber Assignment for Material Master Records\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe material number can either be entered externally by the user, or assigned internally by the system. Both internal and external number assignment is possible. If you do not enter a material number when creating a material master record, the system automatically carries out internal number assignment.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n93\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCreating a Material Master Record\\n\\nCreating a Material Master Record There are two ways of creating a material master record:\\n\\nA new material master record is created with or without reference. It is mainly the responsibility of materials management to create new material master records in the system.\\n\\nAn existing material master record is extended by creating new segments for other company areas. Thus, a view which has not yet been maintained is added to the material master record.\\n\\nThis documentation describes the material master record exclusively from the sales view. Therefore, the following description refers to adding new views to already existing material master records.\\n\\nSteps:\\n\\nUsing the example of trading goods (HAWA), the section below describes how to extend a material master record.

In contrast to changing a material master record, you add new views to the data records when maintaining. The main difference between maintaining a material master record and creating it, in the sense of adding another view, is that, when maintaining, more selection criteria are available to you. These selection criteria are not available for the function Change and Create.\\n\\nThe maintenance status tells you which department has already maintained the material master record.

The rest of the goods are free. This is called Inclusive free goods and means that part of the purchase quantity is designated as free goods and is not billed.\\n\\nThe material supplied as free goods always has the same unit of measure as the purchased quantity.\\n\\nOf ten bottles of wine, two are designated as free goods. If you order ten bottles, then ten are delivered but you are not billed for two of them. You have received inclusive free goods.\\n\\nExclusive agreement,\\n\\nThe customer pays for the goods ordered and receives additional goods. This is known as exclusive free goods and means that free goods is granted for an additional quantity to that in the purchase order. More is delivered than was ordered and the additional quantity is not billed.\\n\\nThe goods delivered as free goods do not have to be the same as material ordered.\\n\\nWhen four coffee machines are ordered, the vendor supplies a packet of coffee as free goods. Therefore, if you order four coffee machines, you receive a free packet of coffee.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nYou create a free goods agreement in the same way as you do a condition. You can set the requirements governing when free goods are granted at as many levels as required, e.g. at customer/material level or customer hierarchy/material level. The standard system provides for customer/material level. The free goods agreement has a validity period. In the free goods agreement you can save different rules for determining the free goods quantity. You can determine a minimum amount for the sold material. The free goods only then apply from this minimum amount. The free goods quantity can be defined proportionally to the quantity of the material sold. Another rule defines the free goods quantity per full unit of the material sold. I.e., free goods might be granted only for a certain number of full pallets and not for partially loaded pallets.\\n\\nFree goods processing is supported in the sales order for direct sales. When creating the sales order, the free goods items are created automatically according to free goods agreement. The free goods are represented as an item. The free goods item is a subitem of the originating item. The free goods items are relevant for delivery and are copied to the delivery. The free goods item\\n\\n106\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nBasic Functions in SD\\n\\ncan be copied to the billing document. It is possible to have the free goods in the invoice as free of charge items.\\n\\nIn the sales order and in the billing document, pricing can be carried out for a free goods item. An automatic discount of 100 percent at the end of pricing ensures that the item is free of charge. This facilitates representation in the statistics and in the Profit Analysis. The free goods can be represented there not only as manufacturing costs but also as a special type of sales deduction.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\nFree goods is currently only supported on a 1:1 basis.

This icon indicates a different exclusive free goods material in the first list.\\n\\nIf you do not enter an exclusive free goods material, the system automatically uses the sales material.\\n\\nYou can also branch to free goods maintenance from the pricing conditions maintenance screen.\\n\\nIf possible, data from the condition record are proposed for the free goods (e.g. customer number, material number).\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n111\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nFree Goods in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nFree Goods in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIf you grant free goods to a customer, you can implement automatic free goods determination. The system automatically create a free goods item in the sales order. The item is free of charge. For inclusive free goods, the main item is automatically reduced by the free goods quantity. For exclusive free goods, the quantity of the main item remains the same.\\n\\nYou grant 2 pieces of a material as free goods when the customer orders 100 pieces. For inclusive free goods, the two pieces are deducted from the quantity of the sales material and created as a separate free of charge item. For exclusive free goods, the customer receives two additional pieces as an additional free of charge item (see figure below).\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nCustomizing\\n\\nFree goods determination requires Customizing settings in SD basic functions.\\n\\nMaster Data\\n\\nFree goods determination requires that the free goods be maintained in the master data.\\n\\n112\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nFree Goods in Sales and Distribution Processing\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nFree goods determination in the customer order\\n\\nThe free goods records have a validity period. They are accessed using the pricing date.\\n\\nThe free goods item is determined automatically by the system, according to the data in the free goods record. In the standard system, item category TANN is set for free goods items.\\n\\nYou can also enter free goods manually by entering item category TANN as the item category in double line entry. In this case, however, the system will not access the master data and the control parameters contained therein.\\n\\nThe system informs you if an order does not reach the minimum quantity specified for free goods. In Customizing, you can make the system disregard this message or even set it as an error.(Select: Sales and Distribution -Sales - Sales documents - Define variable messages. This case concerns message V4 160).\\n\\nYou can view a free goods analysis carried out by the system. In the order, select: Environment - Analysis - Free goods - On. The system displays the key it uses to access the free goods master data. It also informs you if free goods is not possible (e.g. for product selection).\\n\\nYou can change the free goods quantity. The system issues an error message if the free goods quantity exceeds the quantity of the material ordered.\\n\\nOther than the quantity, no other data is available for entry in the free goods item.\\n\\nSubsequent changes to quantities or dates can be made to the main item. This means that free goods determination is carried out again.

The standard system provides pricing procedure RVAA01 and condition type NRAB.\\n\\nCondition type NRAV is set up as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt does not determine a discount from a condition record. It uses condition basis formula 029 in the pricing procedure to determine a discount from the free goods factor.\\n\\nThe condition receives the new pricing requirement 059 in the pricing procedure. This requirement checks whether free goods have already been determined.\\n\\nThe condition type receives condition category f. This condition category ensures that the condition is redetermined every time the quantity is changed, since this can also mean a change to the free goods quantity.\\n\\nExample: Free goods assignment without item generation in an order item:\\n\\nCondition type\\n\\nCondition value:\\n\\nPR00\\n\\n10 pieces at 10 USD\\n\\n100 USD\\n\\nRA00\\n\\n10 %\\n\\n10 USD\\n\\nNet 1 Free goods (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\\n\\n9 USD\\n\\n3 pieces at 9 USD\\n\\n90 USD\\n\\n27 USD\\n\\nNet 2\\n\\n6.30 for one piece\\n\\n63 USD\\n\\nThe free goods quantity is shown in printouts (e.g. for order confirmations or invoices).\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n117\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nThe free goods quantity can not be used in the Profitability Analysis or for statistical purposes.\\n\\nThe free goods are generally treated proportionally during partial billing. There are no variants defined in the standard system, although you can create them by defining your own condition basis formulae (full discount in the first/last billing document, for example).\\n\\nThe billing document does not create separate items. If you require this, you must use the procedure for inclusive free goods with item generation (see above).\\n\\n118\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nDynamic Product Proposal\\n\\nDynamic Product Proposal\\n\\nUse\\n\\nA product proposal is a list of products for a specific customer that is automatically proposed during sales document processing. You can determine yourself which materials should be displayed as product proposals in the sales document. You can also specify the sequence in which the materials are to be displayed in the product proposal.\\n\\nDuring sales document processing, the system displays a product proposal in the item overview, according to the customer and business transaction. It displays the material number, material description and the historical order quantities in the sales unit last used. To use them again, you can just copy them.\\n\\nThe system does not run the standard checks (pricing, availability, incompleteness, material determination, free goods determination, and so on) until you enter the order quantities.\\n\\nThe product proposal acts both as an entry aid and also an aid to sales support and promotions. It is particularly useful tool in the telephone sales area. During sales document processing the materials, that are particularly relevant for a particular customer, are displayed to the processor. This enables them to provide appropriate advice to the customer quickly and easily. You can use the sales document history to analyze the customer\\'s purchasing habits and recognize straightaway if their behavior changes, for when instance when they suddenly stop ordering a product.\\n\\nThe product proposal differs from cross selling in that it is dependent on the customer and sales area, and is therefore displayed in the sales document as soon as you have entered a customer. Cross selling, on the other hand, is triggered by the material. In other words, the system proposes cross-selling materials according to the material or a characteristic of the material you have entered.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou must make the following settings in Customizing:\\n\\nDefine the customer pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n\\nDefine the document pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n\\nAssign the document pricing procedure for the product proposal to sales document types\\n\\nMaintain the table of origin for the product proposal\\n\\nDefine the procedure for the product proposal and specify the access sequences\\n\\nMaintain procedure determination (in background) for the product proposal\\n\\nMaintain procedure determination (online) for the product proposal\\n\\nYou can find these settings in Customizing for Sales and Distribution under Basic Functions. For more detailed information about these settings, see the Implementation Guide for the Product Proposal.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nYou can determine the product proposal from different data sources:\\n\\nOrder history\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n119\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDynamic Product Proposal\\n\\nListed materials\\n\\nExcluded materials\\n\\n\\n\\nItem proposal\\n\\nCustomer/material info records\\n\\nCustomer-specific data sources\\n\\nFor the product proposal you can combine materials from other data sources: For example, you could combine the total of all materials in the last n-sales orders with all materials listed for the customer, plus all materials in certain item proposals, but not including those specified in the exclusion. You can then determine the sequence in which they appear yourself.\\n\\nYou can access the data sources either online, in background processing, or using a combination of both. It is also possible to have a combination of both access techniques. If you want to access various different data sources, we recommend that you use background processing, in order to keep the system load as low as possible while working online.\\n\\nWorking with the Product Proposal in the Sales Document\\n\\nAs soon as you have entered a sold-to party in the sales document, the system calls up the function module for determining the product proposal and runs the accesses according to the online product proposal procedure.\\n\\nAll materials that it finds for the product proposal are automatically displayed as proposal items in the sales document.\\n\\nNone of the normal checks at item level, such as the availability check and pricing, are carried out for the materials included as product proposals. These checks are only carried out when you have given the material an order quantity and an item number is assigned.\\n\\nIf you have entered the order history as a data source in Customizing, the system also displays the historic quantities for each material.\\n\\nIn standard system the fields with historic quantities are displayed at the end of the table. When working with the product proposal, SAP recommends placing the field with historic quantities, for example behind the field Order quantity.\\n\\nThe checks are only carried out (for example, pricing, availability check) when you enter the order quantities for a material from the product proposal. The item then receives an item number.\\n\\nThe Source field shows which data source was used to determine the product proposal for each item (for example, O = order history). If a material is determined from several sources (such as the listing and order history), the system displays the first data source used to determine the material, according to the access sequence defined in Customizing.\\n\\nYou can use Product proposal active <-> inactive pushbutton to hide or display materials from the product proposal. This only applies to items where no quantities have been entered.\\n\\nWhen the order history is the source of the product proposal, you can use the Copy IP quantity pushbutton to copy the quantities from the first column with the most up-to-date information (usually the last order) as an order quantity.\\n\\n120\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nDynamic Product Proposal\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\nThe system does not generate a product proposal when you use:\\n\\nBatch input\\n\\n\\n\\nIncoming IDocs\\n\\nBAPIs\\n\\nChange/display sales document\\n\\nCreate sales document with reference\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n121\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCross Selling\\n\\nCross Selling\\n\\nUse\\n\\nMail order catalog retailers frequently use cross selling to increase sales. When a customer orders an article over the phone, the order taker can suggest additional articles that the customer might buy. For example, if the customer orders a VCR, you might suggest purchasing some blank tapes; for a cellular phone, a leather carrying case.\\n\\nArt. 1234 CD Player $89.99\\n\\n? ? ?\\n\\nArt. 1234 CD Player $89.99\\n\\n$102.98\\n\\nArt. 1238 CD Holder $12.99\\n\\nThe sales transaction takes place as normal: The customer chooses an article and the order taker enters it on the sales order screen. The order taker can press Enter after each article, or wait until the customer has finished selecting the article he or she wants.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the order taker presses Enter after entering the data for one article, then a dialog box appears automatically, displaying a list of articles to be suggested to the customer. These cross selling articles are ones that pertain specifically to the purchased article.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the order taker waits to press Enter until the customer has finished ordering, then the dialog box appears automatically, this time showing all of the articles in the sales order, along with their corresponding cross selling articles.\\n\\nThe articles that appear in the cross selling dialog box always depend on which articles are in the sales order. If you want to have the system suggest articles based on the customer\\'s past purchasing history or other factors, see Dynamic Product Proposal [Page 119] in the standard SD documentation.\\n\\nThe cross selling dialog box displays the following information:\\n\\n122\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nCross Selling\\n\\nArticle number\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nSales unit of measure (each, 3-pack, etc.)\\n\\nPrice per unit of measure (calculated either by the standard R/3 pricing scheme or by a custom pricing scheme you have defined)\\n\\nAvailability check\\n\\nDelivery flag (that is, whether the cross selling articles can be delivered independently of their corresponding main articles in the sales order, or whether the cross selling articles can only be shipped either together with or after the main articles have been shipped)\\n\\nYou can turn off the availability check in Customizing, thereby increasing system performance.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nYou can set up the system so that if a customer orders a specific article, a list of other suggested articles appears as well. If the customer chooses to accept one of the suggested articles, the article is flagged in the sales transaction data indicating that this article was a result of cross selling. You can then analyze the results in the Business Workbench or Retail Information System to see how successful your cross selling strategy is (that is, how frequently a suggested article is actually purchased by the customer).\\n\\nFor each article, you can assign one or more cross selling articles.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nTo set up cross selling, you must make the following settings in Customizing:\\n\\nCreate the conditions tables, access sequence, and calculation schemes for determining cross selling articles, since the cross selling function relies on the conditions technique. (Alternatively, you can use the analysis discussed in “Activities” below to create the data automatically.)\\n\\nCreate a cross selling profile with the following attributes:\\n\\n− Determination of cross selling articles via function module\\n\\n− Price calculation scheme\\n\\n− Scheme using conditions technique\\n\\n− Flag indicating how the cross selling dialog is to appear\\n\\n− Flag indicating whether an availability check is to be performed\\n\\nAssign the cross selling profile to a sales area, document scheme, and customer scheme.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nIn order to determine which products are most frequently purchased together, you can use report SDCRSL01 (transaction SE38) to analyze sales orders for a specified period time (for example, for the previous 30 days). The system will search through all the orders, list all the articles purchased, and how often certain pairs of articles (or even three or more) appeared in the same\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n123\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCross Selling\\n\\nsales order: for example, 10% of the time, customers purchased a specific shirt-and-tie combination. In this way, you can mine the R/3 database to find article combinations that might not have occurred to you (for example, a movie and a CD with the sound track for the movie.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can manually assign combinations of articles for cross selling purposes, based on other information you may have.\\n\\n124\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nMaterial Determination\\n\\nMaterial Determination\\n\\nUse\\n\\nMaterial determination enables the automatic substitution of materials in sales documents during sales order processing. For example, during the course of a sales promotion, the system can, during sales order entry, automatically substitute a material that has promotional packaging. A consumer product may have a special wrapper for, for example, the Christmas season. Using material determination, the system substitutes the material only during the specified period.\\n\\nThe following graphic illustrates the determination of a promotional product in the sales order.\\n\\nMaterial determ.\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nEntered material\\n\\nSubstituted material\\n\\nIItem\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\n4711\\n\\nM1\\n\\n10\\n\\n4711 M1\\n\\nE.g.: Promotion material\\n\\nIn addition, you can use material determination if you want the system to automatically substitute, for example:\\n\\n\\n\\ncustomer-specific product numbers with your own material numbers\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational Article Numbers (EANs) with your own material numbers\\n\\ndiscontinued materials with newer models or products\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n125\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCreating Master Records for Material Determination\\n\\nCreating Master Records for Material Determination To create a material determination record, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIn the SD Master Data Screen [Ext.] select, Products → Material Determination → Create.\\n\\nYou reach the screen Create Material Determination: Initial.\\n\\n2.

In reality, however, there are situations where you want to substitute the product ordered with an alternative, for example a product that is repackaged for Christmas, or with a free sample or coupon.\\n\\nWith the product selection functions in the R/3 System, you can flexibly manage product substitution. Based on your priorities for the customer account and restrictions imposed by the customer, you can ship a promotional item when the customer requests a standard one.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nProduct selection functions rely heavily on the condition technique and material determination.\\n\\nThe documentation for this function deals with automatic product selection. If you prefer using a manual process for proposing alternative products and generating messages, refer to the general documentation on material determination [Page 125].\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nThe standard available-to-promise (ATP) check is available to help you determine exactly what to ship. A check is carried out:\\n\\nAt order entry\\n\\nThis ensures that sufficient quantities of the product acceptable to the customer are available to meet the requested delivery date.\\n\\nAt picking\\n\\nThis ensures that your preferred substitute is shipped. If there is insufficient stock of the item, the system fulfills the order with other alternative items.\\n\\nWith product selection functions, you can set the system to automatically select products according to their availability and priority. For tracking purposes, the system stores data about what the customer has ordered. You can use this information as a reference, or for printing invoices and packing lists.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n127\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProduct Selection\\n\\nProduct Selection\\n\\nUse\\n\\nProduct selection uses material determination functions to automatically propose a variety of substitute products based on your requirements, customer requirements, and product availability.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nWhen you enter a material in a sales order, the system checks whether you have set up product selection for this material. If so, it creates a list of possible alternatives, checking each to determine current stock availability, and whether the customer would accept it based on the product attributes.\\n\\nFor each valid substitute that if finds, the system creates a sub-item.\\n\\nIf there is not enough inventory for the alternatives to completely confirm the requested quantity, the system confirms the partial amount and transfers the open quantity to planning. (This depends on your settings for the substitutes [Page 147].)\\n\\nThe system carries out a new product selection when you trigger the availability check on the main item, for example when you change a quantity or date. Depending on the substitution reason [Page 135] that you specify, substitutes are also redetermined in the delivery.\\n\\n128\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nEvaluating the Substitution Procedure\\n\\nEvaluating the Substitution Procedure Before setting up product selection, you must determine how substitution is to be carried out, as well as evaluate the process flow from beginning to end. Here are several questions to help you prepare:\\n\\nHow are substitute products determined?\\n\\nBy the product entered in the order, or by material group?\\n\\nHow many substitutes are offered for each product?\\n\\nHow are they prioritized?\\n\\nAre there any product attributes that would cause a customer to refuse or accept a substitute?\\n\\nFor example, coupons, packaging, or special offers.\\n\\nAre products substituted consistently, or does the substitution process change according to dates or seasons?\\n\\nWhat is the date range validity for the substitution rules?\\n\\nFor example, material A is substituted with material B in November and December. The rest of the year, it is substituted with material C.\\n\\nWhat number is printed on documents?\\n\\nThe product number entered in the order, the substitute product number, or both?\\n\\nIs this consistent for all documents, for example, order confirmations, deliveries, and invoices?\\n\\nHow is pricing performed when a product is substituted?\\n\\nAre prices based on the product entered or the substitute product?\\n\\nAre standard item and schedule line categories suitable for your company’s product selection?\\n\\nThe standard item categories are TAX (main item) and TAPS (sub-item).\\n\\nTheir schedule line categories are CX and PP respectively.\\n\\nShould the system carry out a new product selection when you copy data from document to document?\\n\\nFor example, you may want a new product selection when copying from sales order to delivery, but not from sales order to return.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n129\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nConfiguring Product Selection\\n\\nConfiguring Product Selection Product selection is controlled by a range of Customizing activities, mainly for material determination.\\n\\nThe following topics explain the configuration procedure step by step.

Review the field catalog, condition tables, access sequences, and condition types in the standard system to determine if they fit your company\\'s version of product selection. If not, you can modify the field catalog and create condition tables, access sequences, and condition types that meet your requirements.\\n\\nProcedures\\n\\nModify the field catalog (OV26)\\n\\nThe field catalog for material determination contains fields used by the system to determine substitute products. Review the fields in the standard catalog. If your company determines substitutes based on a field not listed in the catalog, simply add it:\\n\\n1. Add the new field to the user include structure:\\n\\n− Header data KOMKDZ\\n\\n−\\n\\nItem data KOMPDZ.\\n\\n2. Add coding to the routines for assigning values to the new fields in order processing in program MV45AFZA. Use user exits:\\n\\n− USEREXIT_MOVE_FIELD_TO_KOMKD (header fields)\\n\\n− USEREXIT_MOVE_FIELD_TO_KOMPD (item fields)\\n\\n3. Add the new field to the field catalog (Customizing activity Basic Functions → Material Determination → Maintain prerequisites for material determination → Maintain field catalog).\\n\\nCreate a condition table for substitution (OV16)\\n\\nThe condition table serves as the format and eventual storage area where detailed condition records on product substitution mappings are stored.\\n\\nTo create a table, perform the Customizing activity Maintain prerequisites for material determination → Create condition tables:\\n\\n1. Enter a table number, using a number greater than 500, or leave the table field blank for the system to assign a number automatically.\\n\\n2.

The link between procedure and document type directs the system to the selection records that are processed during order entry.\\n\\nBy making this assignment, you are essentially \"turning on\" substitution for specific document types. If you do not make an assignment, the system does not check for substitutes even if the records exist.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nTo assign a product selection determination procedure to document types, perform the Customizing activity Basic Functions → Material Determination → Assign procedures to sales document types (transaction OV14).\\n\\n134\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nCreating Substitution Reasons\\n\\nCreating Substitution Reasons\\n\\nPrerequisite\\n\\nThe substitution reason directs how the system performs product selection. With this reason, you can specify, for example:\\n\\nWhat products should be printed in documents, such as an order confirmation\\n\\nWhether the selected products should be reevaluated when the document is referenced, for instance when a delivery is created\\n\\nWhether the selected products should be copied directly from the source document, from returns for example.\\n\\nProcedure To create a substitution reason, perform the Customizing activity Basic Functions → Material Determination → Define substitution reasons (transaction OVRQ):\\n\\n1. Choose New entries.\\n\\nEnter substitution reason key and a description.\\n\\n2. Select the Entry indicator if you want the original material (not substitutes) to be printed in documents.\\n\\n3. Leave the Warning and Strategy indicators blank.\\n\\nDo not mark these indicators, or you will not be able to perform automatic product selection based on ATP.\\n\\n4. Assign either outcome A or B depending on your preferences for the following:\\n\\nSubstitution Outcome Reason Codes\\n\\nOutcome\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nCreate as sub-items\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nNew product selection in delivery\\n\\nYes\\n\\nNo\\n\\nYou must choose either A or B. Do not leave this field blank.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nOne of the most important decisions that you have to make about the product selection process is whether or not substitutions determined in the order are to be redetermined in the delivery.\\n\\nOUTCOME A\\n\\nWhen you assign outcome A to a substitution reason, note the following special processing features and constraints:\\n\\nThe system redetermines product substitutions when copying them from sales documents to deliveries.\\n\\nRush orders are not supported.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n135\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCreating Substitution Reasons\\n\\nMain item and sub-items must be carried through from the sales document, to the delivery, to the billing document.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you use listings and exclusions in the sales document process, the system does not take them into account when redetermining substitutions in the delivery.\\n\\nThe system uses only the copy rules associated with the main item when transferring data from document to document.To transfer the sub-item from order to delivery, assign copy rule 110 to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nItem category usage indicator PSHP is used for the main item, and PSEL for the sub-item.\\n\\nOUTCOME B\\n\\nWhen you assign outcome B to a substitution reason, note the following special processing features and constraints:\\n\\nThe system does not redetermine product substitutions when copying them from sales documents to the deliveries. All items are copied directly.\\n\\nRush orders are fully supported.\\n\\nMain item and sub-items do not have to be carried through from the sales document, to the delivery, to the billing document.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf listings and exclusions are used in the sales document process, the changes made as a result influence the delivery documents.\\n\\nThe system takes copy rules for both the main and sub-items when transferring data from document to document.\\n\\n\\n\\nItem category usage indicator PSA1 is used for the main item, and PSA2 for the sub-item.\\n\\nIn this example, product selection is performed in the order.\\n\\nIf you select outcome A, the system carries out a new product selection in the delivery. At the time the delivery is created, there is more inventory available for the first alternative material, cold tablets with coupon. In this case, the system ignores the second alternative and confirms the entire requested quantity of the first alternative.\\n\\nIf you select outcome B, the product selection from the order is copied directly to the delivery. There is no new availability check.\\n\\nSubstitution Outcome Scenario\\n\\n136\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nRequested Cold Tablets 100 PC Substitution Cold Tablets w/coupon\\n\\n50 PC\\n\\nCold Tablets 10% Free\\n\\n50 PC\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nOUTCOME A\\n\\nOUTCOME B\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nCreating Substitution Reasons\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nRequested Cold Tablets 100 PC\\n\\nSubstitution\\n\\nCold Tablets w/coupon\\n\\nATP\\n\\n100 PC\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nRequested Cold Tablets 100 PC\\n\\nSubstitution\\n\\nCold Tablets w/coupon 50 PC\\n\\nCold Tablets 10% Free 50 PC\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n137\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSetting Item Categories\\n\\nSetting Item Categories There are two separate item categories in sales documents for product selection. The item category TAX contains specifications for the main item (original product). The other, TAPS, contains specifications for the sub-items (substitute product).\\n\\nReview the item category configurations in the standard system. If these do not meet your requirements, perform the activities in the following topics to modify the item category configuration, or create your own categories. Note that if your product selection procedure requires that pricing be done at the main item instead of the sub-item, you will have to create new item categories.\\n\\nThe following examples detail how pricing is carried out at the main item level and sub-item level for product selection.\\n\\nIn this first example, the price for the order is determined based on the price condition records for the main item only. You have deactivated pricing for the sub-item category, so the system does not determine a price for it. Since both the main item and the sub-item categories are relevant for billing, the prices (even if there is no price) are copied to the invoice and billed accordingly.\\n\\nPricing at the Main Item\\n\\n$ 0.50 PC\\n\\nCold Tablets\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nRequested Cold Tablets $ 0.50 PC Substitution Cold Tablets w/coupon\\n\\nNo Price\\n\\nInvoice\\n\\nCold Tablets 10% Free\\n\\nNo Price\\n\\nRequested Cold Tablets $ 0.50 PC Substitution Cold Tablets w/coupon\\n\\nNo Price\\n\\nCold Tablets 10% Free\\n\\nNo Price\\n\\nIn this second example, the price for the order is determined based on the price condition records for the sub-items.

Review the standard sales document item categories for product selection. If you decide that these do not meet your business requirements, for example if you require that pricing be done at the sub-item level rather than the main item level, create new sales document item categories.\\n\\nProcedures\\n\\nWe recommend that you copy, then change the standard sales document item categories instead of creating them from scratch. To copy categories, perform the Customizing activity Sales → Sales Documents → Sales Document Item → Define item categories (transaction VOV7).\\n\\nTo copy the main item category, select the entry TAX and choose Copy.

For example, you may have customers who refuse products produced abroad, or products that contain a coupon. When you define product attributes, the system checks them in product selection, ignoring any material with a product attribute that the customer has explicitly rejected.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nYou can store information for up to ten product attributes in both the material master record and the ship-to party master record:\\n\\nDefine product attributes in the material master\\n\\nTo assign product attributes to a material, choose Logistics → Sales and distribution → Master data → Products → Material →=<Material> → Create or Change.

Mark the attributes that apply.\\n\\nAttribute 1 could be defined as a material that is packaged with a coupon, for example, while attribute 2 could indicate that the coupon is worth less than $0.50. If the material contains a coupon for $1.00, you would select attribute 1 only.\\n\\nTo assign meaningful names to the attributes, refer to the documentation on reserve fields in the IMG. Choose Sales and distribution → System Modification → Create new fields (without condition technique) → Reserve fields in the customer master record. Double click on this title and scroll down to the Using reserve fields section.\\n\\nDefine product attributes in the customer master\\n\\nSelect Logisitics → Sales and distribution → Master data → Business partners → Ship-to party (if different from the sold-to party). Enter a customer and choose the Sales view in the sales area data. Choose Environment →→→→ Product attribute. Mark the product attributes that the customer is not willing to accept.\\n\\nFor example, mark attribute 1 if the customer does not want products with coupons. Mark only attribute 2 if the customer is willing to accept a product with a coupon, but only if its value is greater than $0.50.\\n\\nIf you change the ship-to partner during order entry, the system carries out a new product selection to ensure that the attributes of the product and the customer are compatible.\\n\\nUnlike in manual product selection, in automatic product selection you cannot set the system to issue a warning or error message when the preferences of the customer do not match the product attributes assigned to the material. If the customer preferences and product attributes are not compatible, the system simply does not propose the product as a possible substitute.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n149\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProduct Selection in Sales Orders\\n\\nProduct Selection in Sales Orders\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nThe system carries out product selection automatically in the sales order when you enter a material for which you have set product selection functions in Customizing [Page 130].\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\n1. You enter an item and choose Enter.\\n\\n2. Before performing the standard availability check, the system checks to determine if the product is currently on substitution.\\n\\nIf so, the system uses the requested delivery date in the header to determine a list of possible alternatives.\\n\\n3. The system runs several checks on on each possible substitute, for example to determine if the customer would accept the product based on the product attributes [Page 149] and current stock availability.The system checks substitute materials until the order quantity is satisfied, or until there are no more possible substitutes. When a valid alternative is found, the system creates a sub-item for it, using the item category [Page 138] that you have defined for the main material in Customizing.\\n\\nIf there is not enough inventory for the alternatives to cover a required quantity, the system confirms only the available amount and ignores the rest. The main item contains information on the confirmed quantity of the sub-item, but is not relevant for planning. For this reason, the material shortage is not passed on to planning.\\n\\nIf you set the material requirements planning indicator [Page 147] for one of the alternatives, however, the system creates an additional sub-item for this material, assigning it a confirmed quantity equal to zero, and a required quantity equal to the open quantity. Since this material is placed as the final alternative in the substitution, it captures any remaining quantities. The system takes this item into account and passes the material shortage on to planning.\\n\\n4. Based on your settings Customizing, the system performs pricing at the main or sub-item level.\\n\\nIf you make any changes to the main item, the system automatically rechecks availability and recalculates prices for all items in the substitution list.\\n\\n150\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nProduct Selection in Deliveries\\n\\nProduct Selection in Deliveries\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nDepending on your settings in Customizing, the system carries out a new product selection in the delivery. This function allows you to recheck the available quantity of the substitutes and make the adjustments necessary to ship the largest quantity of preferred materials to the customer.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nWhen you create a delivery for an order containing a product that is on substitution, the system checks:\\n\\nThe substitution reasons [Page 135] assigned to the alternative products\\n\\nIf you have specified outcome A, the system carries out a new product selection in the delivery. If you have specified outcome B, sub-items are copied unchanged into the delivery from the order.\\n\\nFor zero quantities\\n\\nIf the customer has rejected a product, or there is no available inventory for a substitute, the sub-items contain a zero quantity. The system determines whether these items should be included in the delivery from the delivery item category [Page 141].\\n\\nThe main and sub-item categories [Page 138] to calculate weight at the appropriate level\\n\\nNote that if the main item is weight/volume relevant, you must create a new VOFM copy routine to copy this value from the order.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n151\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProduct Selection in Billing Documents\\n\\nProduct Selection in Billing Documents\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nThe system prices materials based on your settings for main and sub-item categories [Page 138].\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nThe system copies delivery items determined in product selection directly into the billing document. There is no new product selection.\\n\\n152\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nProduct Selection in Returns\\n\\nProduct Selection in Returns\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nWhen you create a return with reference to a previous document, you must take copy rules into account for items determined in product selection.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\n1. You create a return. The system copies items from the order based on copy rules [Page 144] for the item category.\\n\\nYou have already set the system to copy order items determined in product selection exactly as they are.\\n\\n2. After products are copied to the return, you manually change the quantity of the sub-items to reflect the actual amount being returned. The system automatically adjusts main item calculations to reflect these changes.\\n\\n3. You continue with the standard delivery and billing processes.\\n\\nNote that the system does not carry out product selection in return deliveries, regardless of your settings. All entries are copied as they are from the return order.\\n\\nProduct selection functions are supported only in returns that are based on orders. There are no Customizing settings for product selection in billing documents. If you create a return in reference to an invoice, the system automatically copies all schedule lines. You must then manually delete items that you do not want. Additionally, the system does not copy quantities. These you have to enter manually in the return.There is no quantity correlation between main and sub-items.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n153\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSpecial Functions\\n\\nSpecial Functions\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIn addition to standard sales order functions, there are other functions influenced by product selection. These are:\\n\\nRescheduling\\n\\nChanging manual item categories\\n\\nListing/Exclusions\\n\\nCustomer/Material information records\\n\\nSatisfying orders\\n\\nReferring to open quotes and contracts\\n\\nForward scheduling\\n\\nAllocation\\n\\nAutomatic batch determination\\n\\nMinimum order/delivery quantities\\n\\nBill of material (BOM) substitution\\n\\nDifferent units of measure (UOM)\\n\\nWeight/Volume\\n\\nChanging partners\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nRescheduling\\n\\nWhen you reschedule (transaction V_V2), orders that contain items determined in product selection are reevaluated. If the substitution settings have changed, or there is more product available, the system may determine other substitutes. This may result in products being promised to the customer other than those agreed to at the time of order entry. To avoid this, you can set the fixed date and qty indicator in the order (choose Goto → Item → Schedule lines). The system will not take the order account when rescheduling.\\n\\nItems determined in product selection are only considered in a rescheduling run when you have set the input parameters to include all materials. If you specify only certain materials, main and sub-items from product selection are excluded.\\n\\nThe fixed date and quantity indicator does not influence product selection in the delivery.\\n\\nIf a product selection item has been partially delivered, the system does not take it into account in rescheduling runs.\\n\\nChanging manual item categories\\n\\nIf you change the main item category after product selection has been run, the system processes the sub-item category accordingly, but does not delete the sub-item.\\n\\n154\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSpecial Functions\\n\\nIf you would like to change a main item with an item category that is not valid for product selection (for example, third party orders), you must add this item category to the condition table/access sequence and process it accordingly.\\n\\nFor third party orders, only the main item is passed to the purchase requisition, not the sub-items.\\n\\nListing/Exclusions\\n\\nIf you create listings or exclusions for a customer, the system processes them before confirming substitute items in the order. If any of the materials are affected and removed from the list of possible alternatives, the system issues a message informing you.\\n\\nThis function is also available in the delivery.\\n\\nCustomer/Material information records\\n\\nIf the customer uses a different material number than your internal number, you can create a customer-material info record. Customer material info records can be used in conjunction with product substitution at either the main or sub-item level.\\n\\nIf a record refers to a sub-item, only a portion of the detail data is copied to the schedule line. The minimum order and delivery quantities, and the plant are not copied, for example.\\n\\nFulfilling orders\\n\\nIn product selection, the system consumes the available inventory of each substitute prior to checking the available inventory of the next alternative. It does not optimize its proposals to give the customer the least possible number of alternatives. This means that there may be a single alternative that would completely satisfy the customer order. But because the substitutes are consumed one at a time in order of priority, the customer is shipped several products:\\n\\nMaterial entered: Product A\\n\\nRequested quantity is 30\\n\\nCondition record for alternatives:\\n\\nProduct A ATP qty 10 - substitute 1\\n\\nProduct B ATP qty 20 - substitute 2\\n\\nProduct C ATP qty 30 - substitute 3\\n\\nThe system proposes:\\n\\nProduct A ATP qty 10 - substitute 1\\n\\nProduct B ATP qty 20 - substitute 2\\n\\nThe system does not select product C although it would satisfy the order completely. For the system to consume product C first, you would have to reprioritize it as substitute 1.\\n\\nReferring to open quotes and contracts\\n\\nIn the standard system, you can set the system to inform you in standard orders if existing quotes or contracts exist for any items. When you activate this function, you can reference a schedule line to the existing document. These schedule lines then take on pricing and additional information from the reference document.\\n\\nThis function is for the main item only in product selection, not sub-items.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n155\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSpecial Functions\\n\\nForward scheduling\\n\\nForward scheduling is supported in product selection.\\n\\nAllocation\\n\\nThe system does not take substitutes that are on allocation into account.\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nAllocation - Allowed Amount\\n\\nProduct A\\n\\n50 pieces\\n\\nProduct B\\n\\n50 pieces\\n\\nSubstitution Routine\\n\\nMaterial entered:\\n\\nProduct A\\n\\nSubstitute\\n\\nProduct A\\n\\nProduct B\\n\\nIf you were to place an order for 100 pieces, the system would normally propose 50 pieces of product A and 50 of product B. However, when allocation is coupled with product substitution, the system does not accept the alternative materials. Instead, it issues a message informing you that 100 pieces remain after product selection.\\n\\nAutomatic Batch Determination\\n\\nProduct selection and automatic batch determination do not work together in the sales order. The system substitutes products based on their available quantities, then carries out batch determination to find an appropriate batch for the quantity entered. In this case, the system may select items that do not have valid batches in the available inventory.\\n\\nMaterial PRODBATCH-01 has a substitution routine/batches as follows:\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nSubstitution\\n\\nBatch number\\n\\nQuantity\\n\\nStatus\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01\\n\\n1\\n\\nBATCH01\\n\\n10 pieces\\n\\nGood\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01a\\n\\n2\\n\\nBATCH01A\\n\\n30 pieces\\n\\nBad\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01c\\n\\n3\\n\\nBATCH01B\\n\\n40 pieces\\n\\nGood\\n\\nIf you book an order for PRODBATCH-01 for 40 pieces, the system displays the following data for product selection and automatic batch determination:\\n\\nLine\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nQuantity\\n\\nBatch number\\n\\nENTERED\\n\\n010\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01\\n\\n40 pieces\\n\\nSUB 1\\n\\n011\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01\\n\\n10 pieces\\n\\nBATCH01\\n\\n156\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSpecial Functions\\n\\nSUB 2\\n\\n012\\n\\nPRODBATCH-01a\\n\\n30 pieces\\n\\n------------\\n\\nThe system issues a warning informing you that it could not select a batch.\\n\\nMinimum order/delivery quantities\\n\\nThe system does not process minimum order and delivery quantities in sub-items (either from material master or customer-material info records).\\n\\nBill of material (BOM) substitution\\n\\nProduct selection does not support substitution for BOM main or sub-items.\\n\\nDifferent units of measure (UOM)\\n\\nDifferent units of measure for substitutions are not permitted. For example, you cannot substitute one case of material 1 with two cases of material 2.\\n\\nThe base unit of measure, in this example one case, must be consistent between the material entered and its alternatives.\\n\\nWeight/Volume\\n\\nWhen you set the weight/volume relevance indicator for the main item category, the weight/volume of the main item is based only on the values of the main item, not the sub-items. The system does not consider the weight/volume of the sub-items in the calculation.\\n\\nThe system does not automatically copy the weight/volume values of the main item into the delivery or the billing document. If you need to view the weight/volume of the main item in the delivery, or if you want to use pricing conditions based on weight/volume that are repriced in the billing document, write new VOFM data transfer routines. Refer to SAPNet Note 71603 for more information.\\n\\nIf the weight/volume relevance indicator is set for the sub-item category, the weight/volume is based on the actual weight/volume of the sub-items. The system automatically copies these values into subsequent deliveries and billing documents.\\n\\nChanging partners\\n\\nYou cannot change partners assigned in the product selection items.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n157\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaterial Listing and Exclusion\\n\\nMaterial Listing and Exclusion\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nMaterial listing and exclusion lets you control which materials specific customers may or may not buy. For example, if you create a material listing for a specific customer, the customer can only order products from that list. You can also create a master record for material exclusion for a particular customer. Then the customer can not order excluded materials from you.\\n\\nThe following figure shows the functionality of material determination.\\n\\nPayer R1 Payer R1\\n\\nSold-to party A1\\n\\nSold-to party A2\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSold-to party: A1 : R1 Payer\\n\\nMaterial listing\\n\\nItem\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nCust\\n\\nA1\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\n4711\\n\\n10 20 30\\n\\n4711 4713 4714\\n\\nA1\\n\\n4712\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nR1\\n\\nR1\\n\\n4711\\n\\n4713\\n\\nSold-to party: A2 : R1 Payer\\n\\nItem\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\n10 20 30\\n\\nR\\n\\n4711 4712 4713\\n\\nPartner Functions in Material Listing\\n\\nMaterial listing applies to two partner functions in Sales & Distribution: the sold-to party and the payer.\\n\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 system, when the sold-to party and payer are different, the material listing check is as follows:\\n\\n158\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nMaterial Listing and Exclusion\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the sold-to party has a material listing, the system only checks this listing (no other check takes place).\\n\\nThe material listing for a sold-to party can include materials that do not appear in the material listing for the payer (for example, in the case of materials that are rarely ordered or only in exceptional cases)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf there is no listing for the sold-to party, but a listing has been created for the payer, the system automatically checks the payer’s listing.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf no material listing data exists for either the sold-to party or payer, then the customer may order any material.\\n\\nCustomizing\\n\\nYou make the settings for this in Customizing for SD Basic Functions.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n159\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCreating Master Records for Material Listing and Exclusion\\n\\nCreating Master Records for Material Listing and Exclusion To create a material listing or exclusion record, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIn the SD Master Data Screen [Ext.] select, Products →===Listing/exclusion →Create.\\n\\nYou reach the Create Listing/Exclusion: Initial Screen.\\n\\n2.

In order to ensure that the goods arrive safely, a forwarding agent may be commissioned with the delivery. A sales employee processes the business transactions in the company.\\n\\nThe component Partner Determination in Sales and Distribution enables you to display the partners involved in the business transaction, their functions and their business relationships in the R/3 system. When creating or processing sales documents, the system can determine the partners automatically.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nUsing Other Components in Logistics\\n\\nIn partner determination the system takes data from the business partner master records. In the component hierarchy the business partner master data for Customer and Vendor is assigned to Logistics - General (LO) - Logistics Basic Data: Business Partners - Customer or Vendor.\\n\\nWith Financial Accounting (FI)\\n\\nAs accounting data is always needed for processing a business transaction, sales and distribution data is created for a business partner in a common master record.\\n\\nFrom an accounting view there are customers Customers and vendors Creditors. Therefore, customer master data is managed in a customer master record and vendor master data is managed in a creditor master record.\\n\\nWith Human Resources (HR)\\n\\nThe master records for the partner type Personnel (e.g. sales personnel) are maintained in the personnel master record in the application component Human Resources (HR) - Personnel Management (PA). If HR is not used in your company you can also create a personnel master record yourself for employees in sales and distribution.

As these functions are as a rule absolutely necessary for sales and distribution processing, they are defined in the system as obligatory functions. You can change this setting in Customizing or define other functions as obligatory functions.\\n\\nYou can define other partner functions in the customer master or in the sales document.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nPartner functions are classified using partner types. Partner types enable general scheduling of partner functions in creditors,customers, personnel and contact persons.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nThe following partner functions exist, for example, in the standard system for sales and distribution:\\n\\nPartner Type Customer\\n\\nSold-to party\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\n166\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nPartner Functions\\n\\nBill-to party\\n\\nPayer\\n\\nSold-to party authorized to release against a contract:\\n\\nYou can define the sold-to party authorized to release against a contract in the partner screen of a contract. This partner may only schedule orders with reference to this contract, even when he is not the sold-to party authorized against a contract.\\n\\nPartner Type Contact Person\\n\\nContact persons are natural persons whom you must contact at the customers for business processing (for example, purchasers) It is not necessary for you to be a customer employee, you could, for example, be an independent advisor.\\n\\nYou can create contact persons directly in the customer master record. You are then assigned to this customer. The contact persons can however be assigned to other customers.\\n\\nPartner Type Vendor\\n\\nForwarding agent\\n\\nA forwarding agent is an example of a business partner on the credit side, who is included in a sales process. If you commission a particular forwarding agent for deliveries to a specific customer, you can define the forwarding agent in the customer master record as the partner.\\n\\nPossible partner functions on the credit side in the sales process are for example, interpreters, auditors.\\n\\nPartner Type Personnel\\n\\nEmployee responsible\\n\\nSales personnel\\n\\nYou can enter an employee from your firm as the person responsible:\\n\\n−\\n\\nIn the customer master: if the employee is normally responsible for processing transactions with this customer\\n\\n−\\n\\nIn the sales document: if the employee is responsible for processing the business transaction.\\n\\nThese functions are also significant in Sales Support (CAS).

You can achieve this by assigning permitted partner functions to an account group.\\n\\nExamples from the system:\\n\\nThe partner function SP can be taken from a customer of one of the following account groups: 0001 (sold-to party). 0005 (sales prospect), 0007 (sales partner), one-time customer. . .\\n\\nThe partner function AG cannot take customers from the following account groups: 0002 (ship-to party), 0003 (payer) or 0004 (bill-to party).\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nIf you have created a new partner function of the partner type Customer, you must then assign a partner function to the account groups for which it is permitted.\\n\\nCustomizing\\n\\nYou can make these settings in Customizing for Sales and Distribution for partner determination.\\n\\nYou can find further information in the implementation guide (IMG) for sales and distribution under Basic functions →=Partner Determination →=Assign partner functions on the debit side to account groups.\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\nAccount groups [Page 29]\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n171\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPartners in the Sales and Distribution Process\\n\\nPartners in the Sales and Distribution Process\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nThe following shows how partner determination is used in sales and distribution processing. The procedure is divided into two parts:\\n\\nI.\\n\\nCreating master records\\n\\nII.\\n\\nCreating sales documents\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou have implemented the settings described in the section Partner control [Page 164] in Customizing.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nI. Creating Master Records\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIf you create a customer master record, you must first of all decide which functions this customer fulfils in the business process. Then you select the account group for the customer.\\n\\nIf your customer merely acts as the ship-to party, create a master record for a ship-to party. In this case the system automatically proposes the account group 002. The partner can then only occur as the ship-to party.\\n\\nYou can find further information on the account group under Account groups [Page 29].\\n\\n2. Then you can determine which other partners are involved in the business transactions and which functions these partners fulfil, for example, additional ship-to party, contact person or forwarding agent. In the screen Partner functions sales area, assign the possible functions to the customer and enter the other partners and their functions. All of the partners that you enter here must already have a master record.\\n\\nIf you create a master record for a sold-to party, the obligatory functions ship-to party, bill-to party and payer are automatically assigned with the sold-to party You can, however, overwrite the partners, if the partner functions have been defined in Customizing as changeable.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThe following table contains some examples of which partner combinations appear on the market and which activities you execute in the R/3 system, in order to show these relationships in the customer master record.\\n\\nScenario:\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\n172\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nPartners in the Sales and Distribution Process\\n\\nThe partner issues orders, receives the goods and the invoice and pays.\\n\\nYou create a sold-to party master record for the customer (account group 001).\\n\\nCustomer A has three partners, to whom goods can be delivered.\\n\\nYou create a sold-to party master record for customer A. In the screen Partner Functions Sales Area enter all three possible ship-to parties.\\n\\nThere are master records for the three partners with the possible partner function SP. You have not defined the function SP as definite in Customizing.\\n\\nCustomer 101 is the sold-to party, the invoices are paid for by customer 102 (e.g. central payment point.\\n\\nYou create a master record for the sold-to party. In the screen Partner functions Sales Area change the default Customer 101 to Customer 102 in the field Payer PY.\\n\\nA master record exists for customer °102 with the possible partner function PY.2\\n\\nForwarding agent T is generally commissioned with deliveries to customer 4.\\n\\nIn the screen Partner Functions Sales Area enter the additional partner function SP and the forwarding agent creditor number.\\n\\nA vendor master record exists for the forwarding agent.\\n\\nII. Creating Sales Documents\\n\\n1. When you create a customer sales order, enter the sold-to party.\\n\\nYou can also enter a ship-to party first. The system then uses this to determine the sold-to party.\\n\\n2. Using the sold-to party the system extends the partner created on the partner screen in the customer master record for the functions, which have been determined for the corresponding document type in the partner determination procedure (if it has not been determined in Controlling partner origin [Page 170] in the partner determination procedure, that specific functions are not dependent on the sold-to aprty but are taken by another partner function.\\n\\nIf several partners have been created in a customer master for a function, a screen appears on which you can choose the valid partners for this document.\\n\\nIf no partner has been defined in the customer master for a partner function, this function is not automatically transferred into the document. You can enter this function manually onto the order partner screen.\\n\\nIf a partner function has been defined in the partner determination procedure as an mandatory partner function, but no partner has been defined in the customer master, you must enter the partner manually otherwise the order will be incomplete.\\n\\n2fn\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n173\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPartners in the Sales and Distribution Process\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf required, change the partner in the partner screen for the document header or the document items.

The system then checks if the business partner is authorized to release against the contract.\\n\\nDepending on the settings in Customizing, the system determines whether a partner is authorized to release against the contract by checking against one of the following:\\n\\nPartners in the contract (Rule A)\\n\\nIf the partner has the partner function AG (sold-to party) or AA (sold-to party for release order) in the contract, the system accepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release order.\\n\\nPartners in the hierarchy (Rule B)\\n\\nIf the partner who wants to release against the contract is the sold-to party of the contract or at a lower level in customer hierarchy to the sold-to party in the contract, the system accepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release order.\\n\\nAfter the authorization check, the system also checks if more than one ship-to party is defined in the contract. If the contract contains a WE (ship-to party) and several AWs (ship-to party for release order), the system lists the possible ship-to parties in a dialog box. You select the appropriate ship-to party for the release order.\\n\\nYou can define authorized sold-to parties (AA) and additional ship-to parties (AW) in the customer master record. When you create a contract for the customer, these partners are proposed for selection.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou activate the partner authorization check in the Customizing activity ‘Define Sales Document Types’.\\n\\nPartner determination procedure KAB (partners in contract) contains the partner functions AA and AW. You must assign this procedure to the sales document types for which the partner authorization check is relevant. You make this assignment in the Customizing activity ‘Define and assign partner determination procedures’.\\n\\nIn the standard R/3 System, the partner releasing against the contract and the ship-to party which you select are copied into the release order. If you want to control which partners are copied into the release order, you can define a copying routine for the relevant document types in the Customizing activity ‘Maintain Copying Control for Sales Documents’. For example, you can specify that only the sold-to party releasing against the contract is copied into the release order and the other partners are determined from the customer master record of the sold-to party.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nIf rule B is defined for the contract type, you can search for authorized partners for a release order using the contract number. Equally, you can search for the relevant contract for a release order using the partner number. In this case, the partner authorization rule is irrelevant.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n181\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nAuthorized Partners for Release Orders\\n\\n182\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nTexts in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nTexts in Sales and Distribution\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nIn a business relationship, it is essential that business partners exchange information throughout the logistics chain. In sales and distribution, this exchange of information is supported by texts in master records and documents.

In addition the following processing and control functions are supported:\\n\\nTexts are proposed from the master records in the sales and distribution documents, if you have made the appropriate setting.\\n\\nTexts can be copied from a reference sales and distribution document into another sales and distribution document (e.g. from an inquiry into a sales order or from an order into a delivery).\\n\\nThe copying of texts can be made language dependent, if required.\\n\\nYou can change copied texts.\\n\\nYou can integrate standard texts into the sales and distribution documents.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n183\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nTexts in Master Records\\n\\nTexts in Master Records The following figure shows some of the texts which are defined for customer and material master records in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.\\n\\nCentral texts\\n\\nCustomer sales\\n\\nAccounting note Marketing note . . .\\n\\nAccounting Accounting texts Dunning texts\\n\\nPayment\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nContact person Partner note Directions Decision-making authority . . .\\n\\nSales and distribution\\n\\nCustomer sales Shipping Markings for\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nDocument\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nSales text Purchasing text . .\\n\\nTexts by View\\n\\nThe processing of texts in the customer master record is dependent on view.

It can also be entered manually in the sales and distribution document. As the form header text appears at the top of all sales and distribution output, you should reserve it for important information for the business partner.\\n\\nAnother important header text is the supplementary text. It appears, for example, at the bottom of the order confirmation in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.

You can maintain a separate text for each document item.\\n\\nThe material sales text is an important item text, as it describes the material in more detail. In the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, it is copied automatically from a reference document or a sales and distribution text.

A large number of texts are solely for internal information purposes and are not included in the sales and distribution forms. Thus, you can enter packing information for the shipping department as an item text.\\n\\nYou can specify, which texts are to be used for internal purposes and which are to be used in the sales and distribution forms.

Neither of these texts can therefore be edited as long as the reference texts exist for them.\\n\\nYou can specify if you want a text to be copied from a preceding document or from a master record using access sequences in customizing.\\n\\nThe following figure shows how texts are copied from the master records into a sales document and how the texts are transferred into a subsequent document when it is created with reference to another document.\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nQuotation\\n\\nSold-to party : C1 Sales note\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nSold-to party : C1 Sales note\\n\\nHeader texts Header note Shipping instructions Delivery conditions\\n\\n. .\\n\\nItem Mat.\\n\\nItem Mat.\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\n10\\n\\nM1\\n\\nNote on material\\n\\n10\\n\\nM1\\n\\nNote on material\\n\\nItem texts Material sales text Item note Packing note\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nExample of Copying Text\\n\\nThe standard version of the SAP R/3 System defines that the system uses the following access sequence to find a reference text for the form header text in the sales and distribution document:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIf a relevant header text exists in the reference document header, this text is copied into the header of the sales and distribution reference document. If the header text exists in several languages, the text is copied in all languages into the sales and distribution document header.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf there is no header text in the reference document, or the document is created without reference, the system copies the customer sales note from the customer texts in the customer master record in the language assigned to the sold-to party.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf there is no customer sales note in the sold-to party language, the system copies the customer sales note from the customer sales texts in the customer master record in the language assigned to the sales organization.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n189\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCopying Sales Texts\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf there is no customer sales note in the language assigned to the sales organization, the system copies the customer sales note from the central sales texts in the customer master record in the language assigned to the sold-to party.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIf there is no customer sales note in the language assigned to the sold-to party, the system copies the customer sales note from the central sales texts in the customer master record in the language assigned to the sales organization.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIf the system is not successful in finding an appropriate text, no header text is entered in the sales and distribution document.\\n\\n190\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nReferencing and Duplicating Texts\\n\\nReferencing and Duplicating Texts\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIt is often required for texts in sales and distribution documents that a particular text appears unchanged throughout sales and distribution processing in the documents, for example, that the terms of payment remain in the document header from the quotation phase up until billing.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it may be necessary to change a text in a document without changing this text in the follow-up documents.\\n\\nTherefore, there are two options in SAP sales and distribution processing for transferring a text from a master record or a document into a follow-up document.\\n\\nDuplicating text\\n\\nReferencing text\\n\\nReferencing has the following advantages:\\n\\n− Less storage space is needed.\\n\\n−\\n\\nIt ensures that the text is copied from the document into the follow-up document unchanged.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nIt should be specified in Customizing whether referencing or duplicating is to be carried out for each text type in the text determination procedure.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nDuplicating texts\\n\\nIf a text is duplicated, the system creates a copy of the text. If you change the original text, this has no effect on the text in the follow-up document.\\n\\nYou can also change the copied text without affecting the corresponding text in a preceding or follow-up document.\\n\\nReferencing texts\\n\\nIf a text is referenced, then it only appears once in the database: In the documents in which the text appears, the original text is merely referred to as a reference. If you change the reference text later, the referenced text is automatically changed with it.\\n\\nAs soon as you change a referenced text, the system automatically deletes the reference to the relevant reference text. The text is then duplicated and becomes an independent text, which is no longer affected by changes made to the reference text.\\n\\nThe reference remains lifted, if you change a text and then undo the changes again later.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n191\\n\\nBasic Functions and Master Data in Sales and Distr\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nUsing Standard Texts\\n\\nUsing Standard Texts If you want to use texts more than once, you can enter these texts as standard texts and include them in the master record or document texts. If you define standard texts, they are included in the sales and distribution forms when they are issued.\\n\\nSome standard texts to which you can refer in the sales and distribution documents have been defined in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.\\n\\nNotes on Entering Text\\n\\nYou can use standard texts to give notes to the employee entering an sales and distribution document regarding the information he should include in specific header or item texts and the sequence in which he should do it. For example, by including a standard text such as a header note in the sales document, you can make sure that the employee specifies in the first line whether the customer has taken advantage of a sales promotion in his purchase order and in the second line, how (newspaper, radio etc.) he found out about the promotion.\\n\\nProposals from the Master Records\\n\\nThe standard text above must first of all be created and then included in a text in the customer master. You can define in Customizing whether this text is automatically proposed from the customer master record in the header note of the document header when you create a sales document.\\n\\nStandard texts can be proposed in the documents at header and item level in the same way from the material master record.\\n\\nCreate\\n\\nTo create a standard text, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Select Tools →→→→ SAPscript →→→→ Standard text on the main menu screen.\\n\\n2.

planning support play major roles.\\n\\nIn shipping processing, all delivery procedure decisions can be made at the start of the process by\\n\\nTaking into account general business agreements with your customer\\n\\nRecording special material requests\\n\\nDefining shipping conditions in the sales order\\n\\nThe result is an efficient and largely automatic shipping process in which manual changes are only necessary under certain circumstances.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe Shipping component is integrated under the Logistics Execution component. Shipping is a subsequent activity of the Sales component.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nThe shipping module supports the following functions, which include but are not limited to:\\n\\nDeadline monitoring for reference documents due for delivery (sales orders and purchase orders, for instance)\\n\\nCreating and processing outbound deliveries\\n\\nPlanning and monitoring of worklists for shipping activities\\n\\nMonitoring material availability and processing outstanding orders\\n\\nMonitoring the warehouse\\'s capacity situation\\n\\nPicking (with optional link to the Warehouse Management system)\\n\\nPacking deliveries\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation support for transportation planning\\n\\nSupport of foreign trade requirements\\n\\nPrinting and transmitting shipping documents\\n\\nProcessing goods issue\\n\\nControlling using overviews of\\n\\n− Deliveries currently in process\\n\\n− Activities that still are to be carried out\\n\\n− Possible bottlenecks\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping\\n\\n7\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nA list of deliveries posted as goods issue in the shipping department could be used to form a worklist for the billing department.\\n\\nGoods issue process\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nReference activity (order, etc.)\\n\\nM a yM a yM a y 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 9 3 0 3 1\\n\\nFunctions relevant for shipping: (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Shipping point determination (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Route determination (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Scheduling\\n\\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Monitor shipping due date (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Create outbound delivery\\n\\nWarehouse\\n\\n.......................... .......................... ..........................\\n\\n.......................... .......................... ..........................\\n\\n.......................... .......................... ..........................\\n\\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n\\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Picking\\n\\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Packing\\n\\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Shipping docs\\n\\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) Goods issue\\n\\n8\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDelivery Processing\\n\\nDelivery Processing\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nIn its role as central object of the goods issue process, the outbound delivery supports all shipping activities including picking, packing, transportation and goods issue. During the outbound delivery process, shipping-planning information is recorded, status of shipping activities is monitored and data accumulated during shipping processing is documented. When the outbound delivery is created, the shipping activities, such as picking or delivery scheduling, are initiated, and data that is generated during shipping processing is included in the delivery.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nAn outbound delivery can be created as follows:\\n\\nWith reference to a sales order\\n\\nWith reference to a stock transport order\\n\\nWith reference to a subcontract order\\n\\nWith reference to a project [Ext.]\\n\\nWithout any reference\\n\\nDepending on your requirements, you can create outbound deliveries automatically using worklists, or manually. You can make agreements with your customers for complete and partial deliveries [Page 34] and for order combinations [Page 40]. Outbound deliveries can be combined to form a single group of deliveries [Page 56].\\n\\nOverviews allow you to monitor [Page 189] created outbound deliveries and outstanding sales activities.\\n\\nOutbound deliveries can only be created under certain conditions [Page 21].\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n9\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOutbound Delivery Structure\\n\\nOutbound Delivery Structure The outbound delivery is made up of a document header and any number of items. The following figure shows the structure of the outbound delivery.\\n\\nHeader\\n\\nShipping Point, Route, Shipping Point, Route, Shipping Point, Route, Ship-to Party, Ship-to Party, Ship-to Party, for instance for instance for instance\\n\\nItem 1\\n\\nMaterial or quantity, for Material or quantity, for example example\\n\\nItem 2\\n\\nItem 3\\n\\nDocument Header\\n\\nThe general data relevant for the outbound delivery is stored in the document header. This data is valid for the entire document. The general data may include:\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nData about delivery scheduling and transportation scheduling (for example, the goods issue date or the date of delivery to the ship-to party)\\n\\nWeights and volumes of the entire outbound delivery\\n\\nSold-to party and the ship-to party numbers\\n\\nRoute\\n\\nDocument Items\\n\\nIn the items, you find data that applies to one particular item. This data may include:\\n\\nMaterial number\\n\\nDelivery quantity\\n\\nRetail price [Ext.]\\n\\nPlant and storage location specifications\\n\\nPicking date\\n\\nWeights and volumes of the individual items\\n\\nTolerances for under- or overdelivery\\n\\n10\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nOutbound Delivery Structure\\n\\n11\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDelivery Data and Screens\\n\\nDelivery Data and Screens The user interface for processing deliveries gives you the following advantages:\\n\\n\\n\\nIntuitive navigation among various processing screens results in a user-friendly interface\\n\\nFewer screen changes necessary during processing\\n\\nEasily comprehensible data presentation\\n\\nClear presentation of processing screens even when the screen is small\\n\\nSince the new interface works with flexible tables, you can tailor screen appearance to your needs even during processing. You can change the width and sequence of the columns as you see fit simply by dragging them with the mouse. You can also save various display variants.\\n\\nTab pages are an important element of the interface. They represent a file of index cards and make the interface easier to use. Each tab page has a title that is always visible. By simply clicking on the tab page title, you can move a tab page to the front of the stack and begin editing it.\\n\\nThis tab page method of organization allows related data to be displayed in one place despite limited screen space.\\n\\nShipping data generally appears on the following three screens on which multiple tab pages can be found:\\n\\nOverview screen\\n\\nHeader screen\\n\\n\\n\\nItem screen\\n\\nYou can switch quickly from one screen to another by using icons.\\n\\nTab pages are arranged according to delivery process, which makes it easier to figure out which of the three overview screens you should switch to in order to find the data you are looking for.\\n\\nThe stage that the processing of a delivery item has reached is displayed on the Status Overview tab page on the Overview screen.\\n\\n12\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nOrigin of Data in the Delivery\\n\\nOrigin of Data in the Delivery\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nWhen a delivery is created, data is copied from the master records or preceding documents. By using the delivery type, you must indicate whether the delivery is to be created with or without reference to a sales document.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nCreating Without Reference\\n\\nWhen you create a delivery without referring to a preceding document, the system copies the following data into the document from the appropriate master records:\\n\\nData from the customer master record of the ship-to party\\n\\nData from the material master records of the delivery items\\n\\nIf necessary, you can also change or add to data proposed from the master records.\\n\\nCreating with Reference\\n\\nIn this case, you create the delivery for a particular order or an outline agreement. Data is copied from the preceding document into the delivery. The following figure illustrates how the system copies data from the order into the delivery.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n13\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nOrigin of Data in the Delivery\\n\\nSales order\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nHEADER\\n\\nHEADER Ship-to party : C1 Incoterms : EXW\\n\\nITEM 10 Ship-to party: C1\\n\\nITEM 10\\n\\nIncoterms : EXW\\n\\nSchedule line 1\\n\\nnot due\\n\\nSchedule line 2\\n\\nITEM 20\\n\\nShipping criteria identical\\n\\nShip-to party: C1 Incoterms : EXW\\n\\nITEM 20\\n\\nSchedule line 1\\n\\nShipping criteria not identical\\n\\nITEM 30\\n\\nShip-to party : C2 Incoterms : CIF\\n\\nSchedule line 1\\n\\nHEADER Ship-to party : C2\\n\\nIncoterms : CIF\\n\\nITEM 10\\n\\nSchedule line 2\\n\\nOrder items that are due for delivery and have identical shipping criteria are entered in one delivery. Shipping criteria may include the ship-to party, the shipping point, the Incoterms, or the route. If several schedule lines exist for one item, the system only includes the schedule lines that are available and due for delivery in the delivery document.\\n\\n14\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDelivery Types\\n\\nDelivery Types You can use the various delivery types to deal with the different kinds of business transactions necessary for delivery processing. In the standard version of the SAP System, delivery types include:\\n\\nName\\n\\nDelivery type\\n\\nOutbound delivery\\n\\nLF\\n\\nOutbound delivery without reference LO\\n\\nReturns delivery\\n\\nLR\\n\\nReplenishment delivery\\n\\nNL\\n\\nOutbound deliveries from projects\\n\\nLP\\n\\nOutbound delivery for subcontractor LB\\n\\nInbound delivery\\n\\nEL\\n\\nWMS outbound delivery\\n\\nWOD\\n\\nWMS inbound delivery\\n\\nWID\\n\\nReplenishment WMS\\n\\nWNL\\n\\nCustomer returns WMS\\n\\nWRD\\n\\nDelivery for stock transfer\\n\\nUL\\n\\nR/2-R/3 Link\\n\\nLD\\n\\nWhen you enter an outbound delivery with reference to a sales order, for example, the system automatically proposes the delivery document type on the basis of the underlying order.\\n\\nControl Elements\\n\\nSpecific functions can be defined for each delivery document type. This is done using control elements that are specified in tables. The document types can be tailored to meet the needs of your company. New document types can also be defined if you find that your business needs a wider selection than those specified in the standard version of the SAP System. Your system administrator is responsible for maintaining control elements.\\n\\nYou can distinguish between delivery document types according to the following criteria:\\n\\nWhich number range does the document number come from for internal and external number assignment?\\n\\nWhich partner functions are allowed and which must be entered?\\n\\nDoes an order have to be based on a preceding document?\\n\\nWhich requirements must items fulfill to be included in the delivery? • Should the route be redetermined? Should a check then be carried out to determine whether the new route is permissible?\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n15\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDelivery Types\\n\\nAccording to which rule should the storage location be determined for an item if a storage location is not specified?\\n\\nWhich output types are allowed for the business transaction and according to which procedure are they proposed?\\n\\n16\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nItem Categories in Deliveries\\n\\nItem Categories in Deliveries Item categories are defined so that you have more control over individual materials in the deliveries. The item category is copied from an order item. A standard item in a standard order then becomes a standard item in the delivery. If a delivery is entered without reference to an order, the system proposes the item category depending on the delivery type and the item category group of the material.\\n\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, item categories include:\\n\\nStandard Item Categories\\n\\nName\\n\\nItem category\\n\\nStandard item in a delivery without reference to an order\\n\\nDLN\\n\\nConsignment fill-up\\n\\nKBN\\n\\nFree of charge item (part of a delivery that is free of charge)\\n\\nKLN\\n\\nService free of charge (part of a delivery that is free of charge) KLX\\n\\nMake-to-order production (from standard order)\\n\\nTAK\\n\\nStandard item (from standard order)\\n\\nTAN\\n\\nFree of charge item (from standard order)\\n\\nTANN\\n\\nText item (from standard order)\\n\\nTATX\\n\\nControl Elements\\n\\nThe item categories can also be adapted using control elements to meet the special requirements of your installation. In addition, new item categories can be defined in Customizing if the categories defined in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System do not sufficiently fulfill your shipping requirements.\\n\\nYou can distinguish between item categories using the following criteria:\\n\\nDoes a material number have to be defined for an item? For example, you do not have to specify a material number for a text item.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs a delivery quantity of 0 allowed?\\n\\nShould a check be carried out to determine whether the delivery quantity exceeds the minimum delivery quantity for the material in question?\\n\\nShould a check be carried out to determine whether an item has been overdelivered and whether this overdelivery is allowed?\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the item relevant for picking?\\n\\nShould a storage location be specified for the item?\\n\\nShould the storage location be determined automatically?\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n17\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nItem Categories in Deliveries\\n\\n18\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCreating Outbound Deliveries\\n\\nCreating Outbound Deliveries\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nAs soon as the material availability date or the transportation scheduling date for a schedule line is reached, the schedule line becomes due for shipping. When you create an outbound delivery, you initiate shipping activities such as picking and transportation scheduling.\\n\\nA delivery is processed through one shipping point. Which shipping point carries out the processing for a delivery can be determined automatically during order processing or you can specify it manually in the order.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nCertain prerequisites [Page 21] must be met before an order can be delivered.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nThe system carries out the following activities when an outbound delivery is created:\\n\\nChecks the order and materials to make sure the outbound delivery is possible (for example, it checks for delivery blocks or incompleteness)\\n\\nDetermines the delivery quantity of an item and checks the availability of the material\\n\\nCalculates the weight and volume of the delivery\\n\\nCalculates work expenditure\\n\\nPacks the outbound delivery according to the reference order\\n\\nChecks the delivery situation of the order and any partial delivery agreements\\n\\nRedetermines the route\\n\\nAdds information relevant for export\\n\\nChecks delivery scheduling and changes deadlines (if necessary)\\n\\nAssigns a picking location\\n\\nCarries out batch determination (if material is to be handled in batches)\\n\\nCreates an inspection lot if the material must pass a quality check\\n\\nUpdates sales order data and changes order status\\n\\nYou can make changes in a delivery after it is created if the delivery situation changes in any way. In addition, you can confirm picked quantities using the change function, or use the display function to access shipping information in a delivery.\\n\\nOrder items or schedule lines that have identical shipping criteria are combined in one delivery. If data varies between items, for example, if a different ship-to party is defined for each item, two deliveries must be created for the order. Order items from different orders can be grouped together in one delivery provided that they have identical shipping criteria and that the sold-to party agrees.\\n\\nFor additional information about working with deliveries, see:\\n\\nPrerequisites for Processing Deliveries in Sales Orders [Page 21]\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n19\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCreating Outbound Deliveries\\n\\nUpdating Delivery Status in Sales Orders [Page 23]\\n\\nShipping Point Determination [Page 24]\\n\\nRoute Determination [Page 26]\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling [Page 28]\\n\\nPartial Delivery and Complete Delivery [Page 34]\\n\\nCorrelating Delivery Groups [Page 37]\\n\\nOrder Combination [Page 40]\\n\\nAdditional Shipping Deadlines [Page 42]\\n\\n20\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nPrerequisites for Processing Deliveries in Sales Orders\\n\\nPrerequisites for Processing Deliveries in Sales Orders The entire order, the order items, and the schedule lines for an item must fulfill certain prerequisites before a delivery can be created.\\n\\nHeader level\\n\\nAt header level, the following prerequisites are among those that must be fulfilled:\\n\\nThere cannot be a delivery block at header level.\\n\\nA delivery block can be set automatically, if, for example, your customer has exceeded his or her credit limit.

The entire document acquires the status of fully delivered once all the items have been fully delivered.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n23\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping Point Determination\\n\\nShipping Point Determination Shipping points are independent organizational entities within which processing and monitoring of the deliveries as well as goods issue is carried out. A delivery is processed by one shipping point only.\\n\\nCriteria for Proposing a Shipping Point\\n\\nA shipping point can be determined for each order item. How the shipping point is determined depends on three factors:\\n\\nThe shipping conditions from the customer master record (Shipping screen)\\n\\nFor example, it might have been agreed with the customer that the goods are to be delivered as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe loading group from the material master record (Sales/Plant Data screen)\\n\\nYou could, for example, specify a loading group that defines that the goods must always be loaded with a crane or a forklift.\\n\\nThe delivering plant\\n\\nThis plant is determined per order item either from the customer master record or from the material master record. However, you can also enter it manually for each order item. For more information on determining the delivering plant, refer to the section Data From Master Records [Ext.]\\n\\nThe following figure shows how the shipping point is determined using the data listed above.\\n\\nShipping condition\\n\\nLoad.group\\n\\nPlant\\n\\nShipping pnt ( proposal )\\n\\nPossible Shipping pnt\\n\\n01\\n\\nCRANE\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0001\\n\\n0002 0003\\n\\nSold-to party/ Order\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nOrder- item\\n\\nOn the basis of shipping condition 01, the loading group CRANE and the plant 0001, the system determines shipping point 0001 for the item. Instead of this shipping point, you can also select shipping points 0002 and 0003 if, for example, you know that shipping point 0001 is out of operation or does not have the capacity to deal with the item at the time when delivery is to take place.\\n\\n24\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping Point Determination\\n\\nChanging a Shipping Point\\n\\nYou are still able to change the shipping point proposed by the system in the sales order within specified limits. If you enter a shipping point that is not valid, you will receive the following error message from the system: “Shipping point is not available for this activity.”\\n\\nIf the shipping point cannot be determined because, for example, the delivering plant could not be found in the sales order, an entry is made in the incompletion log in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System. This ensures that the shipping point is entered before the sales order can be processed for delivery.\\n\\nYou can obtain an overview of the shipping points for all order items by choosing Overview →→→→====Shipping in the sales order. You will find the shipping points in the ShPt column.\\n\\nIf you enter a delivery for the sales order, you must always specify the shipping point from which the sales order is to be delivered. The shipping point cannot be changed in the delivery.\\n\\nDelivery by a Shipping Point\\n\\nYou can only carry out delivery processing for the items in a sales order for which a shipping point has been defined. If different shipping points have been assigned to the various items in a sales order, the deliveries have to be processed for each shipping point.\\n\\nIf you create a delivery for a sales order that contains several shipping points, the system reacts as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you create an individual delivery, you receive a note in the log that the items with different shipping points have not been included in the delivery.\\n\\nYou can view the log by choosing Edit →→→→====Log.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you process a delivery via the delivery due list, no note is entered in the log. When you process the delivery due list, the system only informs you of errors that occur during processing.\\n\\nIf the customer requests complete delivery of the sales order, it does not make sense to define different shipping points for the order items since this would lead to the sales order being split into several deliveries.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n25\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nRoute Determination\\n\\nRoute Determination The route determines the means of transport and the legs involved. It influences transportation scheduling. For example, the system can determine from the route that goods are to be sent by rail to Boston. Therefore, during transportation scheduling, it takes into account how far in advance loading space in the freight car must be reserved.\\n\\nCriteria for Route Proposal in the Sales Order\\n\\nA route can be determined for every order item. Determining the route in the sales order depends on the following factors:\\n\\nCountry and departure zone of the shipping point\\n\\nShipping condition from the sales order\\n\\nFor example, it might have been agreed with the customer that the goods are to be delivered as soon as possible.\\n\\nTransportation group from the material master record (Sales/Plant Data screen)\\n\\nYou can use the transportation group to group together goods with the same characteristics (for example, bulky goods or goods that must be transported in refrigerated trucks).\\n\\nCountry and transportation zone of the ship-to party (Control screen in the customer master record)\\n\\nIf the ship-to party is changed in the sales order, the route is determined again for each item.\\n\\nUsing the delivery type, you can control in Customizing whether the transportation scheduling is to be executed once again after a route change has taken place.\\n\\nThe following figure shows how the route is determined in the sales order according to the data listed above.\\n\\nWhere from ?\\n\\nHow ?\\n\\nWhat ?\\n\\nWhere to ?\\n\\nCountry / zone\\n\\nShipping condition\\n\\nTransportation group\\n\\nCountry / zone\\n\\nRoute\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nSold-to party / order\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\n26\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nRoute Determination\\n\\nCriteria for the Proposal of the Route in the Delivery\\n\\nThe shipping document type determines whether the route is determined again in the delivery. Since you only learn the exact weight of the delivery at the time of creating the delivery, it makes sense to determine the route again. For example, an overdelivery of goods could mean that the delivery is now too heavy to be delivered by air freight and must be conveyed by rail. It could also be that several partial deliveries are created for one sales order so that the total weight of the each delivery is now lower than the total weight that is recorded in the sales order. Thus, a smaller truck than originally planned can be used for the delivery.\\n\\nFor this reason, a weight group is used as an additional factor in determining the route. The weight group is determined on the basis of the total weight of the delivery. You can manually overtype the route that is determined by the system in the delivery.\\n\\nUnlike the sales order where a route can be defined for each order item, the route applies to all items in the delivery.\\n\\nThe following figure shows all factors that the system takes into account when it determines the route in the delivery.\\n\\nWhere from ?\\n\\nHow ?\\n\\nWhat ?\\n\\nWhere to ?\\n\\nHow much ?\\n\\nCountry / zone\\n\\nShipping condition\\n\\nTransportation group\\n\\nCountry / zone\\n\\nWeight\\n\\nRoute\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nSold-to party / order\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nConsistency Check\\n\\nOnce a new route has been determined in the delivery, the system can check whether the route determined in the order item and the route found for the delivery are consistent. In the Customizing application, you can define a consistency check for each shipping document type.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n27\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling During order entry, each schedule line for an item can contain a requested delivery deadline. The goods should arrive at the customer on this date. At the order processing stage, the system can automatically schedule when the essential shipping activities such as picking, loading and transporting must be started so that the requested delivery date can be kept.\\n\\nThe terms used in scheduling are defined below. You must distinguish between\\n\\n\\n\\ntimes (time duration) needed to carry out certain activities\\n\\ndates that are calculated on the basis of these times\\n\\nTimes\\n\\nValues based on past experience of the shipping department are entered in the system in the form of transit times, loading times, pick/pack times, and transportation lead times:\\n\\nThe transit time is the time in days that is required to deliver goods from your premises to the customer location. It is defined for a route.\\n\\nThe loading time is the time in days that is required for loading a delivery item. It is determined from the shipping point, the route, and the loading group of the material.\\n\\nThe pick/pack time is the time in days that is required for allocating goods to a delivery as well as the time in days that is required for picking and packing. It is calculated using the shipping point, the route, and the weight group of the order item.\\n\\nThe transportation lead-time is the time in days that is needed to organize the shipping of the goods. This might include booking a ship and reserving a truck from a forwarding agent. It is defined for a route.\\n\\nIf you have not maintained any working times in the shipping point, the unit for the time specification is the day (workday = 24 hours) with two decimal places\\n\\nIf you have maintained the working times in the shipping point, the unit for the time specification is hours, minutes, and seconds.\\n\\nYou can also enter the factory calendar of the forwarding agent for the route when you define the transit time. This factory calendar can be different from your company\\'s calendar. For example, the forwarding agent might operate a 6-day-week.\\n\\nYou may only enter the transit time in days with two decimal places, even if you have maintained the working times in the shipping point.\\n\\nThe following figure shows the different times that are taken into account during delivery scheduling.\\n\\n28\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling\\n\\nDate of order\\n\\nMaterial availability\\n\\nTransportation planning\\n\\nLoading\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nDelivery date\\n\\nTransit time\\n\\nLoading time\\n\\nLead time for transportation planning\\n\\nPick/pack time\\n\\nDeadlines\\n\\nThe following deadlines are of importance for delivery processing:\\n\\nYou must start picking and packing activities on the material availability deadline. This deadline must be selected early enough in advance so that the goods are ready by the given loading deadline.\\n\\nThe transportation scheduling deadline is the date on which you must start to organize the transportation of the goods. This deadline must be selected early enough to ensure that the means of transport is available by the loading deadline.\\n\\nThe loading deadline is the date on which the goods must be available for loading and on which all vehicles that are required to ship these goods must be ready for loading. After the time required for loading the goods (loading time) has expired, goods issue can be carried out.\\n\\nThe goods issue deadline is the date on which the goods leave the company in order to arrive punctually at the customer location.\\n\\nThe delivery deadline is the date on which the goods are to arrive at the customer location. The difference between the goods issue deadline and the delivery deadline is calculated from the transit time required for the route between the delivering plant and the customer.\\n\\nThe delivery deadline can be the customer\\'s requested delivery deadline or the confirmed delivery date (that is, the earliest date on which you can deliver goods to the customer).\\n\\nData in the Sales Order\\n\\nYou will find the appropriate data in the sales order on the Item - Schedule Line - Shipping details screen. You call up this screen as follows:\\n\\n1. On one of the overview screens in the order, select the item whose shipping data you want to look at. Then choose Item →→→→====Schedule Lines →→→→====Quantities/dates.\\n\\n2. Place the cursor on the appropriate schedule line and choose Edit →→→→====Detail Shipping.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n29\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling\\n\\nData in the Delivery\\n\\nYou will find important shipping data at header level in the delivery. For this purpose, choose Header →→→→====Shipment-relev.info from a header or overview screen.\\n\\nThe material availability date can be different for each item. For example, this could be due to large quantities or complicated packaging. You will find this date at item level. Select the item for which you want to display the material availability deadline from the initial overview screen and then choose Item →→→→====Item details. You will find the material availability deadline in the Picking section in the Mat.avail.date field.\\n\\nIn the sales order, the system can determine exactly at which time goods must become available, be loaded, and sent so that they arrive at the ship-to party location on the requested delivery deadline. The two different types of scheduling that are carried out are delivery scheduling and transportation scheduling.\\n\\nDelivery Scheduling - Transportation Scheduling\\n\\nAll activities that must be carried out before the goods can be delivered to the customer are taken into account during delivery scheduling. This includes loading, picking, and packing. Delivery scheduling determines the material availability deadline and the loading deadline.\\n\\nAll deadlines that are used for preparing and carrying out the transportation of goods are taken into account during transportation scheduling. This includes the transit time and the transportation lead time that you need for ordering a foreign forwarding agent or for arranging a truck from the your company\\'s truck fleet. The goods issue deadline and the transportation scheduling deadline are determined by transportation scheduling.\\n\\nScheduling Criteria\\n\\nFor each sales document type, you can define whether a delivery scheduling and/or a transportation scheduling will be carried out.\\n\\nIt is possible to specify by shipping point whether the system proposes loading time and pick/pack time for delivery scheduling. To determine these times, use the following criteria:\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nProcessing may be carried out more quickly in one shipping point than another.\\n\\nShipping point, route, and weight and/or loading group\\n\\nSince the route is required for determining the mode of transport, a delay in processing or quicker processing can be taken into account here. Weight can be important for determining pick/pack time, the loading group from the material master record for determining the loading time.\\n\\nShipping point, weight and/or loading group\\n\\nIf the route is not to be taken into account when the pick/pack time or loading time is determined, the shipping point and the weight become the only criteria used for determining the pick/pack time. The shipping point and the loading group become the criteria used for determining the loading time.\\n\\nThe transportation lead time and the transit time for transportation scheduling are determined using the route.\\n\\n30\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling\\n\\nBackward scheduling is always carried out for both delivery scheduling and transportation scheduling. If backward scheduling determines a material-availability deadline or transportation-scheduling deadline that lies in the past, the system automatically carries out forward scheduling to determine a delivery deadline that can be confirmed.\\n\\nBackward Scheduling\\n\\nThe system first carries out backward scheduling from the requested delivery deadline:\\n\\nRequested delivery deadline\\n\\n./. minus transit time\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGoods issue deadline\\n\\nGoods issue deadline\\n\\n./. minus loading time\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLoading deadline\\n\\nBased on the loading deadline, the system determines two further dates, the transportation planning deadline and the material availability deadline.\\n\\nLoading deadline\\n\\n./. minus transportation lead time\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTransportation scheduling deadline\\n\\nLoading deadline\\n\\n./. minus pick/pack time\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaterial availability deadline\\n\\nThe earlier of these last two dates (material availability deadline and transportation scheduling deadline) determines when a schedule line becomes due for shipping.\\n\\nForward Scheduling\\n\\nIf backward scheduling determines a date in the past as the date on which a schedule line becomes due for shipping or if the material will not be available on the date calculated, the system automatically carries out forward scheduling to determine the earliest possible shipping deadline.\\n\\nFor example, starting from the current date, the system calculates the loading deadline, the goods issue deadline, and then the confirmed delivery date. It does this by adding together the shipping times mentioned above.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n31\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nTransportation and Delivery Scheduling\\n\\nMat. staging\\n\\nOrder date\\n\\nTransp. planning\\n\\nLoad.\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nReq. deliv.date\\n\\nBackwards\\n\\nForwards\\n\\nStaging\\n\\nTransp. planning\\n\\nLoad.\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nDeliv. date\\n\\nRounding Rules for Data\\n\\nIf you have not maintained any working times, the system always rounds dates for scheduling up or down according to normal business practice. In addition to this, different buffer times can be determined for each shipping point and added to the loading time and the pick/pack time. This enables you to take into account possible delays in the shipping activities in advance.\\n\\nDepending on the rounding rule you are using, the system may determine that loading scheduled according to the pick/pack time to be carried out in the afternoon will not be started until the following day. Thus, should picking and packing be held up, the truck is not kept waiting.\\n\\nYou can define the rounding period per shipping point in Customizing.\\n\\nIf you have maintained the working times, the scheduling is calculated exactly.\\n\\n32\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nBackward Delivery Scheduling Only\\n\\nBackward Delivery Scheduling Only\\n\\nUse\\n\\nWhen you change a sales document, such as adding schedule lines or rescheduling, the system carries out delivery scheduling for all the schedule lines, new and old. Because the material availability date lies in the past for backlog schedule lines, the system performs forward scheduling. This may have the undesired affect of the system rescheduling lines that may have already been confirmed.\\n\\nYou can specify for each sales document type that the system is to schedule deliveries only backwards. With no forward scheduling, you can better recognize backlogs in production and the customer receives goods on time.\\n\\nTo deactivate forward scheduling, set the Backward indicator in Customizing for delivery scheduling. Choose Basic Functions → Delivery Scheduling and Transportation Scheduling →= Define scheduling by sales document type.\\n\\nNote that when the availability check has been activated for the schedule line category in Customizing, and availability is poor, the system ignores the Backward indicator and carries out forward scheduling anyway.\\n\\nThis function is available for scheduling agreements and sales orders.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nNormally when you create a delivery for a backlog schedule line, the system resets the material availability date in the delivery to the current date, and copies this date to the delivery.\\n\\nYou can set the system to copy material availability dates unchanged to deliveries for sales document types for which you have set the backward delivery scheduling function. Just turn off rescheduling for the relevant delivery type in Customizing by choosing Logistics Execution → Shipping → Deliveries → Define delivery types. Unmark the Rescheduling field in the Document content section of the screen.\\n\\nIn this way, you can avoid having two requirements with different dates when you make partial deliveries. Also, when you plan requirements again, the system will not propose rescheduling for production orders already in process.\\n\\nWhen rescheduling has been turned off for a delivery type, the system does not redetermine routes.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n33\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPartial Delivery and Complete Delivery\\n\\nPartial Delivery and Complete Delivery A customer may specify that he or she will only accept complete delivery of an order. However, the customer may also agree to accept several partial deliveries for an order or an order item.\\n\\nYou enter the appropriate indicator in the customer master record or in the customer material information record to control this. The indicator is copied into the order. You can change the indicator there. You can also enter the indicator manually in an order. You can also enter the indicator manually in an order. When you process an order or create a delivery, the system checks this indicator to determine whether complete delivery is required or whether partial delivery is permitted.\\n\\nComplete Delivery Indicator\\n\\nIf a customer requires his or her orders to be delivered completely, you must enter the appropriate indicator.\\n\\nEntering the Indicator\\n\\nThere are two places where you can enter this indicator:\\n\\nCustomer master record\\n\\nThis indicator belongs to the shipping data for a customer within a sales area. You enter an X in the Complete Delivery field on the shipping screen of the customer master record. The indicator is copied into the order header.\\n\\nOrder header\\n\\nYou can also enter the indicator X in the Delivery field on the business data screen of the order header.\\n\\nHow the System Reacts\\n\\nIf you try to partially deliver an order to which you have assigned a complete delivery indicator, the system will inform you that the customer requires complete delivery of the order. All items must be delivered at the same time. The items cannot have different delivery deadlines.\\n\\nIf the system cannot include all the items with the total order quantity in the delivery, you receive a message that the customer requires full delivery.\\n\\nIf you enter the complete delivery indicator X, you must set the partial delivery indicator to C (no partial deliveries allowed).\\n\\nPartial Delivery Indicator\\n\\nIf a customer allows partial deliveries for his orders, the delivery can be executed in different ways. You enter the respective indicator, depending on the partial delivery agreement that you have made with the customer.\\n\\nPartial delivery agreements are taken into account during the availability check in the order. These indicators are once again checked when the delivery is created. The delivery must observe the partial delivery agreements in the order.\\n\\n34\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nPartial Delivery and Complete Delivery\\n\\nPossible Indicators\\n\\nThe following partial delivery indicators are defined in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System:\\n\\nStandard Partial Delivery Indicators\\n\\nIndicator Importance\\n\\n\"Blank\" A B C D\\n\\nUp to maximum number of partial deliveries permitted are allowed One delivery attempt carried out on requested date One delivery attempt carried out on any date No partial deliveries allowed Any number of subsequent deliveries allowed\\n\\nEntering the Indicator\\n\\nYou can enter the indicator in various places, such as the:\\n\\nCustomer master record\\n\\nThis indicator belongs to the shipping data for a customer within a sales area.

It does this when the order is created.\\n\\nOrder item\\n\\nYou enter the indicator for an order item on the shipping details screen in the Part.delivery/item field.\\n\\nMaximum Number of Partial Deliveries\\n\\nThe check carried out for the delivery indicators is influenced by the number of partial deliveries permitted for a customer. You enter this number on the same screens in the customer master record and in the order item as you enter the partial delivery indicator, in the Max. part. deliveries field.\\n\\nIf, for example, you specify a maximum number of 3 deliveries, an order item must be fully delivered after three deliveries have been created. If the entire order quantity for the item is not fulfilled once you enter the third delivery, you receive a warning message.\\n\\nOnly if the order item has been assigned the partial delivery indicator D or \" \" does the entry for maximum number of partial deliveries influence the creation of the delivery.\\n\\nHow the System Reacts\\n\\nThe system responds differently depending on which partial delivery indicator is set in an order item. The different reactions are illustrated by the following example. You create a delivery for an order item of 10 pieces. Only 5 pieces are available.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndicator \"blank\"\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n35\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPartial Delivery and Complete Delivery\\n\\nYou can enter as many partial deliveries as you wish for an order item until the maximum number permitted is reached. If the last delivery does not result in the entire outstanding order quantity being reached, you receive a warning message.\\n\\nIn this situation, you can create a partial delivery of 5 pieces for the example. The order item is then regarded as partially delivered. Once the material becomes available again, you would create another partial delivery. This process would continue until the item is fully delivered or the maximum number of deliveries has been reached.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndicator A\\n\\nIf the delivery quantity on this date is not the same as the outstanding order quantity, you receive a warning message. If the delivery quantity is greater than zero, the system marks the order as complete. This indicator is used, for example, when the customer wants you to ship as much as possible on a particular date. If the delivery quantity falls short of the order quantity, the customer wants the order to be marked as complete (that is, wants no backorders).\\n\\n\\n\\nIndicator B\\n\\nThis delivery should fully satisfy the order quantity. If the delivery quantity does not correspond to the outstanding order quantity, you receive a warning message.\\n\\nAny delivery quantity, even zero, completes processing of the order. This indicator can be used, for example, for customers who want no backorders to be generated, even when a delivery quantity is zero.\\n\\nIn Customizing for Sales, you can define for each delivery type whether or not zero delivery quantities are allowed.\\n\\nIf only part of the order quantity can be delivered, a delivery is created and the order item is then regarded as completed.\\n\\nYou can create a delivery for 5 pieces for the order item in the example. The order item is then regarded as completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndicator C\\n\\nComplete delivery is required for an order item.\\n\\nYou receive a warning message if you try to create a partial delivery of 5 pieces for the order item in the example.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndicator D\\n\\nYou can enter any number of subsequent deliveries for an order item until the maximum number of partial deliveries permitted is reached. You can over deliver the original order quantity in the process. An order item can only be assigned the completed status manually. After you assign this status, no further deliveries can be created.\\n\\nYou can create a partial delivery of 5 pieces for the order item in the example and then go on to create any number of subsequent deliveries as long as you do not manually mark the item as completed.\\n\\n36\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCorrelating Delivery Groups\\n\\nCorrelating Delivery Groups Items in delivery groups can be combined in the sales order to synchronize their delivery. You will receive a warning message when creating a delivery for a sales order if all items belonging to such a group cannot be delivered. If you then create deliveries using a delivery due list, all orders whose delivery groups cannot be completely delivered will be ignored in this process. In this case, the log supplies all appropriate information. If the delivery quantity is changed or if such an item is deleted in a delivery item belonging to a delivery group, you will receive a warning message. For further information on delivery groups, refer to Combining Sales Document Items for Delivery [Ext.].\\n\\nIn addition, the system will carry out a quantity correlation for groups of items when they are classified together by one of the following requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\nthe items belong to a common delivery group\\n\\n\\n\\nthe items have a bill of material structure\\n\\nIf the order structure arose from a bill of material explosion, the relations in quantity of the items is based on component quantity. If this is not the case, it is based on the relation of the order quantities. The system does not correlate items classified as having fixed quantities.\\n\\nWhen creating deliveries, the system automatically carries out a quantity correlation. If you change a higher level item’s quantity, the quantities in the dependent items will be adjusted on all levels if necessary. When you change a dependent item’s quantity, the system generates a warning message. When you delete a higher level item, all subordinate items are deleted as well. When you delete a dependent item, the system generates a warning message. If the dependent item contains a quantity to correlate and is the main item of a batch split, you receive a note. You must decide manually for which batches the quantity change is to take place.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n37\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nFree Goods in the Outbound Delivery\\n\\nFree Goods in the Outbound Delivery\\n\\nUse\\n\\nIn many sectors of industry it is common to provide products free of charge, or not to charge the customer for some of the goods sold when certain goods are purchased.\\n\\nFree goods processing [Ext.] is supported in the sales order for direct sales. When you enter the sales order, the free goods items are automatically created in accordance with the existing agreement (see also Maintain Free Goods [Ext.]) and automatically copied into the outbound delivery as delivery-relevant.

The item category is determined on the basis of the delivery type and item category group in the material master record. Thus, items for which an order has to be created first cannot be added to an outbound delivery. Your system configuration dictates which materials can be included in an outbound delivery. In the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, only materials with the item category VERP can be added to a delivery.\\n\\nIn order to add items that are not dependent on an order (such as packaging materials) to a delivery, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. From shipping [Ext.], choose Outbound Delivery →→→→====Change → Single Document.\\n\\nThe Change Outbound Delivery screen appears.\\n\\n2. Enter the number of the outbound delivery to which you want to add an item.\\n\\n3. Choose Enter.\\n\\nThe overview screen appears.\\n\\n4.

In other words, deliveries are the basis for warehouse or transportation planning activities. During delivery processing, it may become necessary to divide up a delivery because of workload planning for picking or the loading capacity limitations of a means of transport, for example.\\n\\nUntil now, this was accomplished by making manual changes to the delivery and then, in a separate step, combining the remaining item quantities to create a new delivery.\\n\\nThe subsequent outbound-delivery split function simplifies this process by accomplishing the same thing in one step. An existing delivery can be split anytime you discover that the delivery contains too many items or is too large to be processed in subsequent functions (picking, goods issue, transportation planning).\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nIn order to use the subsequent delivery function, you must first make the necessary settings in the Implementation Guide (IMG) under Logistics Execution → Shipping → Deliveries in the Subsequent delivery split [Ext.] activity. Pay particular attention to the conditions specified in the \"Requirements\" section of the documentation in the above link.\\n\\nFor example, a delivery split is only allowed if the delivery has a certain status. The delivery split cannot take place if the shipment is completed, or if any goods movements, billing documents or picking quantities yet to be confirmed (at least for the item\\'s split quantity) exist.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nYou can use the subsequent outbound-delivery split to divide existing deliveries into several other deliveries. This function is especially useful, for example, if a smaller means of transport than you expected is all that is available at loading time.\\n\\nYou can split shipping units, delivery items that have not been packed yet, or even partial quantities of delivery items that have not been packed yet. There is always an option of running a simulation of the split beforehand.\\n\\nDuring the subsequent outbound-delivery split, the system checks the status (no goods movements or billing documents, for example), confirms characteristics (delivery groups and correlation), copies data (texts), calculates attributes (volume and weight) and carries out determinations (outputs).\\n\\nThe split result controls which delivery items are grouped together in the same delivery. All remaining items make up the split remainder.\\n\\n52\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDelivery 1\\n\\n18 pallets\\n\\nOriginal delivery\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nDelivery 1\\n\\n5 pallets\\n\\nDelivery 2\\n\\n7 pallets\\n\\nDelivery 3\\n\\n6 pallets\\n\\nRemainder\\n\\nResult 1\\n\\nResult 2\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSubsequent Outbound Delivery Split\\n\\n53\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCarrying out a Subsequent Delivery Split\\n\\nCarrying out a Subsequent Delivery Split\\n\\nUse\\n\\nJust before you begin loading a delivery, for example, you notice that the means of transport is smaller than the one that was scheduled to take on this delivery. So, you decide to split a planned delivery into several smaller deliveries. Your colleagues who are working at the loading ramp specify the delivery items (or shipping units) that will actually be loaded onto the means of transport. The shipping documents, goods movement postings and billing documents should be created based on the quantity that was actually loaded. The rest of the delivery items will be included in another shipment at a later time.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nSelecting outbound deliveries that are to be split\\n\\n1. From shipping [Ext.], choose Outbound Delivery →→→→====Change →=Subsequent Split (Outbound Delivery).\\n\\n2. Enter a split profile in the Split paramtrs section.\\n\\nThe split profile combines all the settings that you made in the Implementation Guide (IMG) and applies them to the current split process. You can predefine a split profile with user parameter LEDSP_PMODE.\\n\\n3. Use the other sections on this screen to further limit the delivery selection. For example, if you know which outbound delivery you want to select, you can enter its delivery number in the Document data section.\\n\\n4. Choose Execute to start the delivery selection.\\n\\nIf there are no outbound deliveries that meet the selection criteria that you specified, a message to that effect will appear.\\n\\nCarrying out the subsequent outbound-delivery split\\n\\n1. Define the delivery items or quantities that are to be split in one of the following ways:\\n\\n− Double-click a delivery item to split the entire item quantity from the original delivery\\n\\nIf you want to split the entire quantity of a delivery item from the original delivery, choose that item by double-clicking it.\\n\\nThe system assigns this item a number, which appears in the list as a current split result number.\\n\\n− Enter a split result number to split the entire item quantity from the original delivery\\n\\nEnter a four-digit number of your choice in the Result field.\\n\\nYou can use the result number to control the combination of outbound deliveries that are involved in the split. If you assign the same result number to the delivery items in one outbound delivery, these items will remain together and appear in the same split result after the split. If delivery items have different result numbers, the split distributes them among several outbound deliveries.\\n\\nIf you selected more than one outbound delivery, please note that result numbers are only ever valid for one outbound delivery. In other words, the same result numbers\\n\\n54\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCarrying out a Subsequent Delivery Split\\n\\ncan be assigned in splits of different outbound deliveries. Entire outbound deliveries cannot be combined by assigning the same result number. Combination by assigning the same result number is only valid for items, as described above.\\n\\n− Enter a quantity to split a partial quantity\\n\\nIf you only want to split a partial quantity of a delivery item, enter that quantity in the Split quantity field. The quantity that appears in the Unpacked quantity field is the maximum quantity that you can enter in the Split quantity field.\\n\\n− Splitting items into different, new deliveries\\n\\nIf you assign different split result numbers for each delivery item in a delivery, you effectively split up these delivery items and distribute each one to its own separate, new outbound delivery. You can use the Split → Highlight function to highlight the corresponding rows in different colors.\\n\\nYou can also combine entries of partial quantities and result numbers. For example, if you enter both a split result number and a partial quantity in each row, the partial quantities of different delivery items will be split among different outbound deliveries. If you want to split one item into more than two partial quantities, you must simulate the split more than once.\\n\\n2. Simulate the split\\n\\nChoose Split → Simulate to get a preview of the effects of the delivery split. The system assigns temporary delivery numbers for the new outbound deliveries that are to be created.\\n\\nIf you are not satisfied with the results of the simulation, you can undo the simulation for separate items by marking those items and choosing Split → Reset simulation.\\n\\n3. Choose Split → Save split to carry out a split based on the simulation.\\n\\nA message informing you of the number of outbound deliveries that were saved and changed appears. The new outbound deliveries (with new delivery numbers) and changed outbound deliveries are still displayed.\\n\\nThe procedure described above is also valid for splitting outbound deliveries by shipping unit, although you should be aware that only the shipping units that are not packed in other shipping units are displayed.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n55\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nGrouping Outbound Deliveries\\n\\nGrouping Outbound Deliveries\\n\\nUse\\n\\nYou can combine outbound deliveries into groups. An outbound delivery can belong to several groups. You can create grouped outbound deliveries manually. When you process a delivery due list, the system combines all the outbound deliveries that it creates into one group.\\n\\nGroup number\\n\\nAll grouped deliveries are identified by a group number. You can use this number to access the group and to find the individual outbound deliveries that belong to that group.\\n\\nMaintaining the group\\n\\nTo create, change, or display a group of deliveries manually, start at shipping [Ext.] in the initial menu.\\n\\nYou then select Group of outb. deliveries to branch to the screen where you maintain a group. Since groups can be formed in various areas of sales and distribution processing, different group types are defined. For general maintenance, the group type is entered manually on a separate screen, and for maintenance of a specific group you can choose the appropriate group type using the menu.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nCreating a group\\n\\nTo create a grouped delivery, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

The analysis gives you an overview of the work required. You can still make manual changes to the planned outbound delivery situation by using the selected delivery list (also called the shipping due date index or shipping due list). This may be used for the following operations:\\n\\nManual selection of documents to be delivered from a larger delivery list\\n\\nManual assignment of actual quantities to be delivered to delivery planning\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the introductory phase of setting automated outbound delivery creation\\n\\nCollective delivery of multiple documents in one step may be especially helpful in the following situations:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf outbound delivery creation occurs regularly in the background. You can create rules for worklist creation in a user role for this delivery and work on the worklist regularly.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the length of time needed between creating the transaction and actual outbound delivery (picking, shipment completion) is longer than the time it takes for picking and scheduling.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf multiple orders are to be combined into one delivery for a certain ship-to party.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nDelivery of documents via collective processing is integrated into the following logistics chains:\\n\\nSales order (cid:1) Outbound delivery (cid:1) Picking (cid:1) Shipment (cid:1) Billing\\n\\nPurchase order settlement\\n\\n(cid:1) Outbound delivery (cid:1) Picking (cid:1) Shipment (cid:1) Billing/internal\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nOperations that are planned for outbound deliveries (deliveries with a delivery list) are taken into consideration. This is currently the case for sales orders and purchase orders (stock transport orders and purchase order returns items). Taking sales orders as an example, the following criteria must be met:\\n\\nQuantity must be confirmed by the availability check of the material in the order\\n\\nCorresponding conditions for writing the delivery list must also be met\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nAs you process the delivery list, you can select documents due for delivery according to certain criteria [Page 65] and either\\n\\nDeliver them immediately in the background, or\\n\\nDisplay them\\n\\nYou can preconfigure the display and processing formats by using user-specific and role-specific delivery scenarios [Page 64].\\n\\n58\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCollective Processing of Documents due for Delivery\\n\\nYou can manually process the operations you display. For instance, you can:\\n\\nDeliver the selected operations\\n\\nSelect manually, using your own judgement\\n\\nSort and filter\\n\\nTotal the weights and volumes\\n\\nDisplay existing (open) deliveries for sales orders\\n\\nGo from the fast display to the document display and change the quantity to be delivered, if necessary\\n\\nReview the deliveries that have been created (view the delivery creation log)\\n\\nGo to document processing (sales order, purchase order, delivery)\\n\\nDelete deliveries\\n\\nThere are two different ways to process documents:\\n\\n\\n\\nIndex processing\\n\\n\\n\\nItem processing\\n\\nIndex processing\\n\\nIn index processing, documents that have at least one of the items due for delivery matching the criteria are selected and these documents and all of their items (regardless of if they meet the item criteria) are then delivered. This is the most efficient way to deliver planned deliveries to the customer on time.\\n\\nYou can use this processing form by making a list category setting (Index list) in the user role.\\n\\nIf you would like a summary of all documents due for delivery, yet want to delivery only those items that meet the item criteria, use the Selected items (= X) setting in the function code profile for delivery creation.\\n\\nItem processing\\n\\nIn item processing (list category = item list or schedule line list), only those items that meet the selection criteria are processed. Item processing is meant to be used for manual processing of the delivery list. You must check the consistency of all the items. Pay special attention to delivery groups, bills of material and material substitutions.\\n\\nFunctions during delivery:\\n\\nThe system combines orders when several operations are delivered simultaneously.\\n\\nThe system makes several attempts to deliver documents that are blocked by other users.\\n\\nAdditionally, the same determinations and checks take place as those during delivery [Page 43] of a sales order in the foreground (storage location determination, route determination, availability check, for example).\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nChoose the selection criteria [Page 65] for the delivery scenario you would like to use.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n59\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCollective Processing of Documents due for Delivery\\n\\nIf you want the list to be displayed or created certain way, change your user role specifications.\\n\\n60\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDelivering Documents Due for Delivery\\n\\nDelivering Documents Due for Delivery\\n\\nUse\\n\\nAs an alternative to Delivery of Individual Sales Orders [Page 43] in the foreground, you can deliver several documents at the same time.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou can tailor the user roles and the delivery scenarios in the standard system to your needs in order to better adapt processing of documents due for delivery to your business processes. In order to make these adjustments, carry out the following steps in Customizing under Logistics Execution →=Shipping → Worklists:\\n\\nConfigure list profiles\\n\\nAssignment of list profiles to delivery scenarios\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nTo process a delivery list in the foreground, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. From shipping [Ext.], choose Outbound Delivery → Create → Collective Processing of Documents Due for Delivery → Delivery scenario of your choice.\\n\\nThe Selection criteria [Page 65] entry screen appears, where you can select criteria according to which the delivery list is to be limited.\\n\\n2. Specify the shipping point for which you want to create the delivery. The system will propose a default value if you use user parameter VST.\\n\\n3. Set a range for the delivery creation date.\\n\\nNormally, the default value for this field is defined for determination of the delivery creation date and can be specified in the user role.\\n\\nThe delivery creation date of a document due for delivery is a result of scheduling. It defines when a document must be created in order to keep the entire delivery on schedule, ensuring that the goods arrive at the customer\\'s place of business on time. Time is also allotted for picking and transportation activities.\\n\\n4. Fill in the selection criteria that will be most helpful for you. Depending on which user role the delivery scenario is carried out with, different selection criteria [Page 65] (taken from the complete list) may be active. You can define which criteria appear in the user role and can be overridden (to some extent) on the User role tab page.\\n\\nThe following selection criteria are important for performance in the following order:\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nDelivery creation date\\n\\nDelivery priority\\n\\nRoute\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n61\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDelivering Documents Due for Delivery\\n\\nForwarding agent\\n\\nGoods issue date\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nDocument number\\n\\n5.

To start the search, choose Program → Execute.\\n\\nThe delivery list either appears or the system issues a message that no documents due for delivery meet the given selection criteria.\\n\\n7. Select the lines that you want to deliver and then choose Create delivery in background.\\n\\nAfter you create deliveries, the Log for delivery creation function appears in the status bar of the delivery list. Use this function to check the deliveries that were created and the messages added to the log. The delivery items that were generated and their delivered items are displayed in item or schedule line processing mode.

Either apply a user role for background processing or make a copy of a user role [Page 64] for shipment due processing for yourself. During the test phase, use a function code profile for shipment due list display within this user role.\\n\\n2. Test the shipment due processing [Page 61] with this user role until you only need to execute the Create delivery in background function after the shipment due list is first displayed in order to ship part of the delivery list. (Vary the rules for line selection or for quantity definition during item processing, for instance.)\\n\\n3. Change the function code profile in the user role from Display to Deliver.\\n\\n4.

A delivery is considered to be incomplete if fields relevant for the delivery have not been filled, or if certain settings defined in Customizing have not been taken into account. The delivery incompletion log ensures that this completion check is executed automatically.\\n\\nIn the delivery, you can check the following levels for completeness:\\n\\nHeader data of the delivery\\n\\n\\n\\nItem data of the delivery\\n\\nPartner data\\n\\nTexts\\n\\nYou can either display a list of all incomplete deliveries or go directly from delivery processing to the incompletion log. See also Processing Incompletion Log [Page 70]\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe incompletion log controls whether the next subsequent functions are allowed in the case of an incomplete delivery:\\n\\nInbound delivery Outbound delivery\\n\\nPutaway\\n\\nPicking\\n\\nPacking\\n\\nPacking\\n\\nGoods receipt\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nBilling document\\n\\nAlso, it is possible to set the system so that incomplete deliveries cannot be saved to the database. If, in such a case, the delivery is created in a collective processing run, the reasons for the incompleteness are printed in the collective processing log and the delivery is not created by the system.\\n\\nFor example, you can detect the following situations through the incompletion log:\\n\\nBatches for an item were not assigned completely\\n\\nToo many items were picked or put away\\n\\nRequired description texts are missing\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n69\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nEditing the Incompletion Log\\n\\nEditing the Incompletion Log\\n\\n1.

This status indicates where the item is in the picking procedure (picking has started for item A, for instance).\\n\\nIn the system standard settings, it is a prerequisite for goods issue to be posted before the item relevant for picking can be picked completely. Therefore, delivery quantity and picking quantity (picked quantity) in the outbound delivery must be equal.\\n\\nThe Warehouse Management System (WMS) module is fully integrated in Logistics Execution (LE). For example, you can create a WM transfer order directly from the outbound delivery. The current status of the warehouse management process can also be monitored from the delivery, for instance.\\n\\nYou can transfer all data relevant for picking and verification of picking data to a subsystem by using the Delivery Interface [Page 175].\\n\\nBy using message control, data can be transferred to a subsystem that is being used for picking (see also: Delivery Interface [Page 175]).\\n\\nDepending on the picking procedure being used, you can either determine delivery-relevant data before picking or wait until after picking is completed to record it.

For this normal process, the stock is managed in individual storage bins in the warehouse. For Lean WM, you do not process goods receipts or goods issues as a subsequent process in WM and no storage bins are managed in the WM application. This also means that the WM system does not update stock data using quants. Instead, this transaction takes place entirely at the storage location level.\\n\\nSince Lean WM is used at the storage location level, you can only display quantities of stock in Inventory Management (IM) and not with the WM stock overview task.\\n\\nTransfer Order Characteristics\\n\\nThe characteristics of a transfer order created for Lean WM are basically the same as for any transfer order:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is optional as to whether transfer orders created for Lean WM are subject to confirmation.\\n\\nYou can confirm overdeliveries, shortages and batches.\\n\\nYou can print these transfer orders using normal means.\\n\\nYou can transmit Lean WM transfer order data to external systems.\\n\\nRecording performance data, such as assignment to a picker, return confirmation of actual times or determining planned times is possible for this type of TO.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nBefore you use Lean WM, you need to make a few configuration changes in customizing as follows:\\n\\n1. Create and/or assign a storage location to a warehouse number\\n\\n2. As a minimum you should define at least three storage types:\\n\\n– a storage type (to be used as a source storage type) with one or more fixed storage\\n\\nbins\\n\\n– a shipping area (as a destination storage type) for deliveries\\n\\n– an interim storage area for differences\\n\\nFor customizing activities, see Picking → Lean WM in the SD/Shipping IMG.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nGenerally, the processes used in Lean WM are similar to those in normal WM. There are deliveries and transfer orders are created for the deliveries. However, with Lean WM, it is much easier to create the transfer order.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n75\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nUsing a Transfer Order as a Pick Order in Lean WM\\n\\nTo carry out a stock transfer in Lean WM, there are 3 steps:\\n\\n1. Create a delivery in the SD Shipping component\\n\\n2. Create a transfer order for the delivery.\\n\\n3. Confirm the transfer order.\\n\\n76\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSpecifying Picking Location\\n\\nSpecifying Picking Location\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nPicking is always carried out from a particular storage location. This means that if a delivery item is relevant for picking, a storage location must be entered in the delivery.\\n\\nThe goods are issued from the stock at the picking location that is specified in the delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf picking is carried out using the WM System, the storage location in the delivery determines which storage location in the Warehouse Management System is responsible for picking.\\n\\nThe item category of the delivery item determines whether the item is relevant for picking and whether a storage location must be specified. For example, text items are not relevant for picking and you do not need to specify a storage location. Control over item categories can be set in Customizing.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nSince the information necessary for specifying a picking location is not available when the order is entered, the person responsible for processing sales orders cannot usually make a decision about the picking location. This decision is left until the delivery is created at the shipping point.\\n\\nThere are two ways in which the picking location can be specified:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIt can be determined automatically when the delivery is created and then entered into the delivery item.\\n\\nFor further information on this, refer to Determining the Picking Storage Location Automatically [Page 78]\\n\\n2.

It uses putaway and picking strategies to manage these structures.\\n\\nFor further information about the WM System, refer to Warehouse Management [Ext.]. You will only find information on the interfaces to shipping processing in this section.\\n\\nExample of a Complex Warehouse Structure\\n\\nThe following figure illustrates the type of complex warehouse structure that can be reproduced in the Warehouse Management System (WMS).

The storage bin is determined on the basis of data from WM and is entered in the picking list. Apart from that, picking is carried out in the same way as when WM is not used.\\n\\nWhen the picking list is printed, the picking quantities are automatically entered in the delivery items. If the confirmation from picking informs you that there are discrepancies between the confirmed quantities and the delivery quantities, you must make the necessary adjustments in the delivery. To correct the picking quantity, choose Overview →→→→====Picking and enter the confirmed quantity in the column Pick. quantity.\\n\\nYou can then send a partial delivery. Alternatively, you can carry out picking again to make up the entire delivery quantity:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to create a partial delivery, choose Edit →→→→====Copy the picked quantity. The delivery quantities are adjusted automatically to the picking quantities. You can now post goods issue.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to carry out picking again, print out a new picking list for the difference between the delivery and picking quantities.

If there are discrepancies between the actual picked quantity and the quantity in the delivery, the picking quantity in the delivery item is adjusted automatically.\\n\\nIf the quantities that are confirmed by picking do not match the delivery quantities, you have the following alternatives:\\n\\nTo adjust the delivery quantity to match the pick quantity, choose Edit →→→→====Adopt picked quantities. You create a partial delivery.\\n\\nYou can create another transfer order to carry out picking again for the difference between the picked quantity and the delivery quantity.\\n\\nWhile WM is active, the changes you can make to the delivery are minimal.

Wave picks consist of a group deliveries that are to be processed at roughly the same time. You can create wave picks either manually or automatically according to time criteria. Capacity restrictions can be taken into consideration when waves are formed according to time criteria. If the deliveries that are to be picked are already assigned to shipments, you can refer to these shipments when the wave picks are formed.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nWave picks are groups of deliveries that are identified by a number.\\n\\nYou can execute the following Subsequent Functions for Wave Picks [Page 99] with reference to the wave pick for all deliveries in that wave:\\n\\nPlanning replenishment for fixed storage bins\\n\\nCreating and printing transfer orders\\n\\nConfirming transfer orders\\n\\n2-step picking\\n\\nCreating and monitoring shipments\\n\\nPrinting delivery notes / freight lists\\n\\nPosting goods issue\\n\\nCreating and printing billing documents\\n\\nYou can track the processing status of the wave picks with the wave pick monitor.\\n\\nWave picks do not influence the workload that is displayed in the Rough Workload Forecast [Page 232].\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nLean WM [Page 75] is the minimum implementation requirement in order to work with wave picks and most of the following functions. Of course, you can also work with wave picks if you have implemented the full WM system.\\n\\nYou create the wave picks using exact time parameters. For this reason, exact scheduling (down to the minute) is necessary. However, you can work with wave picks without using such precise specifications if you have implemented the route schedule [Page 224] and are using the goods issue time as the comparison time.\\n\\nFor tips on Customizing, refer to the IMG section on wave picks.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nWave Picks with Capacity Restrictions [Page 87]\\n\\nSubsequent Functions for Wave Picks [Page 99]\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n85\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWave Picks\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nTo create wave picks according to time criteria, you must first divide up the workday into smaller units using time slots. You can group these time slots together using the timeslot group. The system carries out the following steps as it creates wave picks according to delivery time: Before the individual deliveries are assigned to wave picks, the deliveries due are sorted by:\\n\\n1.

The following rules apply, also in the order given:\\n\\n1. An empty status value for the delivery does not affect the aggregated value.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf all the deliveries have the same status value, this status value is adopted as the accumulated value.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIf at least one delivery has the status value B or C, the aggregated value is B.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIf at least one delivery has the status value A, the aggregated value is A.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n89\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWave Pick Monitor\\n\\nThe following rule applies for the aggregation of the status Shp. unit placed into stock. If at least one delivery has the status X, the aggregated value is X; otherwise it is empty.\\n\\nAt both levels, the status fields and their specific description texts are displayed. In addition, the status fields of the wave picks are also displayed as icons.\\n\\nFurther aggregated information is displayed for the wave pick, such as the number of deliveries altogether, and -- for each of the five first status fields -- the absolute and relative number of deliveries for which the respective status is at not processed or partially processed.\\n\\nIn addition, the system displays the processor, document date, beginning time, and end time for the wave pick are displayed.

Shipping units contain items which in turn can be made up of shipping units or delivery items. A shipping unit in a delivery is made up of a shipping unit header and shipping unit items. It is also assigned an identification number.\\n\\nShipping unit header\\n\\nHeader data in shipping units is subdivided as follows:\\n\\nGeneral data\\n\\nThis includes: data which identifies the shipping unit, (shipping unit number, shipping unit external identification number, shipping materials, etc.) data about the weight, volume, and measurements of a shipping unit (tare weight, tare volume, allowed weight, allowed volume, etc.) and data on internal information (plant, warehouse, item category, shipping unit category, etc.).\\n\\nYou can assign an external identification number to a shipping unit. For example, when loading products onto a pallet, you can specify a pallet number. It is also possible to use the International Article Number (EAN) as an external identification number.\\n\\nData about the means of transport\\n\\nThis includes shipping unit identification data as well as data relevant to transportation processing with regard to means of transport.\\n\\nAdditional data\\n\\nThis includes shipping unit identification data as well as user-definable groups of shipping units.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nThis includes data regarding printing and sending output relevant to packing. You can print out a packing list with output type PL00, for example. Additionally, there is a special output type in the shipping unit header (Output 0001) which you can use to create labels to put on shipping units, for example.\\n\\nTo call up the header data in a shipping unit, mark the appropriate shipping units in the delivery listed in the Pack Items screen. Then select one of the following menu paths:\\n\\nShipping unit header →→→→====General data\\n\\nShipping unit header →→→→====Means of transport data\\n\\nShipping unit header →→→→====Additional data\\n\\nShipping unit header →→→→====Output\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n105\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping Unit\\n\\nShipping Unit Items\\n\\nItems in a shipping unit can be made up of delivery items or other shipping units which are displayed in an overview on the Shipping Unit Contents screen. There is also information here on the packed quantity and packing levels. You can identify this information by the ∗ symbol.\\n\\nFor example, the entry ∗∗ in the field Level means that the relevant item has been packed on two levels (the item is in a package or packaging unit that itself has been packed).\\n\\nTo call up the item data for an individual shipping unit, mark the relevant shipping unit in the delivery. Then select Shipping unit contents →→→→====ContentsOfShipUnit in the Pack Items or Pack Shipping Units screen.\\n\\n106\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping Material\\n\\nShipping Material\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nShipping materials are materials used for packing or transporting products. When packing an item, you must always specify a shipping material. Possible shipping materials are shown in the following figure:\\n\\nCardboard Box\\n\\nWire Basket\\n\\nPallet\\n\\nContainer\\n\\nCrate\\n\\nTruck\\n\\nUse\\n\\nFor each shipping material that you want to use in a delivery, you must maintain master data for it in the material master and set the relevant parameters [Page 110] in the Implementation Guide. When creating material master records for shipping materials, enter the material type VERP (packaging). This material type contains additional fields relevant to packing (Sales: general plant tab page). You can make the additional fields available for input by using field selection for each material type.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n107\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping Material\\n\\nThe net weight and volume that you enter in the material master are particularly important for packing. When you create a shipping unit, the system automatically copies the master data for the shipping material. Net weight and volume become tare weight and tare volume.\\n\\nTare weight and tare volume refer to the net weight and net volume of the shipping unit. In the case of a container, the tare weight is the weight of the empty container (the total load weight minus the weight of products not yet packed). The weight of the packaging does not affect the total weight of the delivery. In the SD_DELIVERY_VIEW function module, you can find information on the relevance of shipping materials to total weight. You can call up this function module when printing out delivery and shipment output.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nYou can maintain the following data in the Packaging material data section of the screen by choosing the Sales/general plant tab page in the material master record for shipping materials:\\n\\nShipping material type\\n\\nThe shipping material type is a grouping of shipping materials with various control parameters whose settings can be defined in Customizing for Packing. They control the following:\\n\\nHow the shipping unit is displayed (list of shipping materials according to size, for example)\\n\\nAn output determination procedure in which you define shipping unit output\\n\\nThe shipping unit category into which shipping materials are subdivided In shipping units with the means of transport shipping material category, this category controls the switch for activating additional fields, such as Driver and Passenger.\\n\\nThe plant determination rule that (during delivery processing) determines the plant from which stock of shipping materials should be debited in case delivery items should be created for shipping units [Page 118] in an outbound delivery.\\n\\nMaterial group for shipping materials\\n\\nThe material grouping for shipping materials is a parameter that you use to group together materials that require similar shipping materials. For example, you can assign material group 005 to items that are to be packed in small packages.\\n\\nYou maintain the material grouping for shipping materials for all materials that you want to pack. This field can be maintained for all material types. All other fields detailed here can only be maintained for packing materials (Material type VERP).\\n\\nAllowed package weight\\n\\nIn this field, you may specify a maximum total weight for a shipping unit. If the allowed weight is exceeded during packing, the system generates a message informing you of this fact and, if necessary, continues packing in a new shipping unit.\\n\\nAllowed package volume\\n\\n108\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping Material\\n\\nIn this field, you enter a maximum volume for a shipping unit. If the allowed volume is exceeded during packing, the system generates a message informing you of this fact and, if necessary, continues packing in a new shipping unit.\\n\\nStackability factor\\n\\nThe stackability factor indicates how many shipping units such as pallets, for example, can be stacked on top of one another. This has no control function in Release 3.0. It is for information purposes only.\\n\\nFilling level\\n\\nThe filling level indicates in percent the degree up to which a shipping unit can be filled. This has no control function in Release 3.0. It is for information purposes only.\\n\\nExcess weight tolerance\\n\\nIn this field, you enter in percent a tolerance level that the total weight of a shipping unit is allowed to exceed.\\n\\nExcess volume tolerance\\n\\nIn this field, you enter in percent a tolerance level up to which the total volume of a shipping unit is allowed to exceed.\\n\\nClosed\\n\\nThis field controls whether the total volume is changed or remains the same during packing.\\n\\nIf you pack an open pallet, the total volume changes.\\n\\nIf you pack a closed crate, the total volume does not change.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nShipping materials are a special type of material that can be used for packing or transporting products. During packing, you must always specify a shipping material so that a shipping unit [Page 105] can be generated.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n109\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nControl parameters\\n\\nControl parameters\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nYou must set certain parameters in the Implementation Guide in order to enable the packing function in delivery processing.\\n\\nUse\\n\\nYour system administrator should maintain the following parameters, which relevant for packing, in Logistics Execution → Shipping → Packing [Ext.]:\\n\\nDefine number ranges for shipping units [Ext.]\\n\\nPacking control by item category [Ext.]\\n\\nDefine requirements for packing in the delivery [Ext.]\\n\\nDefine shipping material types [Ext.]\\n\\nDefine material group for shipping materials [Ext.]\\n\\nDefine allowed shipping materials [Ext.]\\n\\nUse shipping unit supplements [Ext.]\\n\\n110\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nPacking Deliveries\\n\\nPacking Deliveries\\n\\nUse Packing delivery items is done directly in the delivery. Choose Edit →→→→====Pack in the quantities overview screen to reach the Pack Items screen.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nThe packing function includes the following functions:\\n\\nPacking delivery items in shipping units and dividing individual items among several shipping units.\\n\\nBesides the normal packing process for packing delivery items into shipping units, you can automatically pack and distribute a certain quantity over several shipping units.\\n\\nMulti-level packing\\n\\nYou can pack shipping units into one another. This transforms the packing function into a multi-level function. You can have up to a maximum number of 999999 packing levels.\\n\\nUnpacking items that have already been packed\\n\\nItems that have already been packed can be unpacked. This also applies to shipping units packed on several levels.\\n\\nSystem response when weight or volume limits are exceeded\\n\\nWhen a weight or volume limit is reached as items are packed into shipping units, the system packs only the maximum packable quantity. If another marked shipping unit that still has room for packing is chosen, packing will continue in this shipping unit.\\n\\nDeleting shipping units\\n\\nShipping units can be deleted in a delivery. In this case, the shipping unit to be deleted is first completely unpacked and, if necessary, removed from higher-level items before it is deleted.\\n\\nEmptying shipping units\\n\\nEmptying a shipping unit is different from unpacking a shipping unit after it has been packed. Here, the relevant shipping unit is completely emptied. When unpacking an item, only certain items are removed from the shipping unit.\\n\\nFast entry of a shipping unit\\n\\nWith the fast entry function, you can manually create shipping units and shipping unit contents.\\n\\nChanging packing quantities\\n\\nYou can change packing quantities in various overviews. The packing quantity, however, cannot be changed after goods issue has been posted. In Customizing for Shipping, you can determine other situations in which packing should not be allowed.\\n\\nCreating delivery items from shipping units [Page 118]\\n\\nYou can create delivery items from the shipping units. In this way, it is possible to manage stocks for the actual shipping materials and to invoice these materials as well.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n111\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPacking Deliveries\\n\\nDisplaying allowed shipping materials\\n\\nYou can display a list of all allowed shipping materials for an item due to be packed provided that the material grouping for the shipping material has been maintained for the relevant material in the packing data section of the material master records.\\n\\nChecking for allowed shipping materials\\n\\nThe system checks whether a shipping material has been designated for packing a certain material. You can control which shipping materials are allowed for packing in Customizing.\\n\\nPacking proposals in sales orders and scheduling agreements\\n\\nIt is possible to create packing instructions in sales orders and scheduling agreements. Using these instructions, the system automatically produces a packing proposal in the delivery. A special data transfer routine in Customizing for copying control between sales documents and the delivery is, however, required. The packing proposal in the delivery can be changed.\\n\\nPacking and the Decentralized Warehouse Management system\\n\\nIf you work with the decentralized Warehouse Management system [Ext.], the packing process has multiple steps.\\n\\na) The packing proposal that is determined by the central system is sent to the decentralized\\n\\nsystem.\\n\\nb) The packing proposal can be transferred or changed in the decentralized system, depending\\n\\non the actual packing process.\\n\\nc) When the delivery verification is sent to the central system, the packing proposal that was originally generated is deleted and replaced with the actual packing procedure from the decentralized system.\\n\\nAutomatic Packing and Batch Split\\n\\nUsing the batch split function, you can define whether the entire picked batch quantity or only single items are to be packed.\\n\\nIf you enter an x in the Pack batch main item field and no split items are available, no items are proposed for packing.\\n\\nIf a packing proposal for a batch material is stored in the order and you do not execute automatic batch determination when you create the delivery, this delivery is not packed automatically.\\n\\nYou must then pack this delivery manually (see Packing Deliveries Automatically [Page 129]).\\n\\nCopying packing data from subsystems\\n\\nIt is possible to copy packing data from a subsystem into a delivery.\\n\\nPacking for multiple deliveries in shipment processing\\n\\nYou can pack in shipment processing as follows:\\n\\n– You can pack delivery items that were not packed in the delivery and did not need to\\n\\nbe packed at that stage.\\n\\n112\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nPacking Deliveries\\n\\n– You can pack shipping units that are on the highest level in the delivery into shipping\\n\\nunits for a shipment.\\n\\nAs packing depends to a large degree on the shipment, packing for a subsequent shipment for the same deliveries may be carried out differently. As in a delivery, you can assign free shipping units to a shipment. The entire contents of a shipping unit in the delivery can no longer be changed after being packed in a shipping unit for a shipment.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n113\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPacking Delivery Items\\n\\nPacking Delivery Items To pack delivery items in shipping units, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

This is illustrated using goods issue for outbound deliveries.\\n\\nYou have the following options for posting goods issue:\\n\\nGoods Issue Posting [Page 140] for individual outbound deliveries\\n\\nGoods Issue in Collective Processing [Page 142] to post goods issue for multiple outbound deliveries\\n\\nGoods Issue in Collective Processing [Page 142] for posting goods issue for multiple outbound deliveries in the background without manual intervention\\n\\nPosting Goods Issue for an Entire Shipment [Ext.]\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nThe outbound delivery forms the basis of goods issue posting. The data required for goods issue posting is copied from the outbound delivery into the goods issue document, which cannot be changed manually. Any changes must be made in the outbound delivery itself. In this way, you can be sure that the goods issue document is an accurate reflection of the outbound delivery.\\n\\nWhen you post goods issue for an outbound delivery, the following functions are carried out on the basis of the goods issue document:\\n\\nWarehouse stock of the material is reduced by the delivery quantity\\n\\nValue changes are posted to the balance sheet account in inventory accounting\\n\\nRequirements are reduced by the delivery quantity\\n\\nThe serial number status is updated\\n\\nGoods issue posting is automatically recorded in the document flow\\n\\nStock determination is executed for the vendor\\'s consignment stock\\n\\nA worklist for the proof of delivery is generated\\n\\nA worklist for the proof of delivery is generated\\n\\nAfter goods issue is posted for an outbound delivery, the scope for changing the delivery document becomes very limited.

These activities include:\\n\\nEntering all necessary data in the outbound delivery. For example, the storage location, batch, or valuation type must be specified in the delivery.\\n\\nPicking of all individual outbound delivery items must be complete for all items for which you have set the Relevant for picking indicator in the Implementation Guide (Logistics Execution → Shipping → Picking section, Define relevant item categories [Ext.] activity). You can post goods issue for picked quantities only.\\n\\nAll transfer orders must be confirmed for individual outbound delivery items if those items were picked using the Warehouse Management System (WMS) or Lean WM and if you have indicated them as having a confirmation requirement in the following sections of the Implementation Guide:\\n\\n− Warehouse Management System (WMS)\\n\\nThe Define storage type [Ext.] activity in the Logistics Execution → Warehouse management → Master data section.\\n\\n− Lean WM\\n\\nThe Define storage type [Ext.] activity in the Logistics Execution → Shipping → Picking →= Lean WM section.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nIf you want to post goods issue for an outbound delivery, proceed as follows:\\n\\nWhen creating or changing an outbound delivery, select Edit →→→→====Post goods issue on one of the overview screens.\\n\\nBefore posting goods issue, you can specify the actual goods issue date without having to change the planned date by entering the actual goods issue date on one of the overview screens.\\n\\nIf you have not made an explicit entry for the goods issue date, the system uses the current date.\\n\\nYou can find more information about posting goods issue for more than one outbound delivery in the Posting Goods Issue with Collective Processing [Page 142] section.\\n\\n140\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nGoods Issue Posting\\n\\nGoods Issue Using the Decentralized Warehouse Management System\\n\\nIf you implement the Decentralized Warehouse Management System [Ext.], you cannot post goods issue using one integrated step. Goods issue in the decentralized WMS is controlled by using the following process flow:\\n\\n1. The delivery is reported to the decentralized system.\\n\\n2. Picking takes place in the decentralized system.\\n\\n3. Goods issue is also posted in the decentralized system. This main objective of this process is to keep goods issue areas well organized.\\n\\n4. Then, the decentralized system reports the delivery to the central system (ERP system).\\n\\n5. Finally, stock is reduced in the central system.\\n\\nThere is no credit check that takes place in the GI posting process.\\n\\nResult\\n\\nAs soon as the delivery is saved and goods issue is posted, you receive a message that contains the delivery number. The goods issue document number is not shown.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n141\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nGoods Issue in Collective Processing\\n\\nGoods Issue in Collective Processing\\n\\nUse\\n\\nYou can use the collective processing function to post goods issue for multiple outbound deliveries at the same time.\\n\\nFirst, select all the outbound deliveries ready for goods issue posting. You can limit the selection by goods issue date, for example. You can choose the inbound deliveries for which you want to post goods issue from the list that appears.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nOnly deliveries that have been fully picked and fulfill the Prerequisites for Goods Issue Posting [Page 140] are included in the goods issue overview.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nTo select outbound deliveries for which goods issue is to be posted, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

XML-enabled Remote Function Call (RFC) interfaces are defined for some master data.\\n\\nShipper account number\\n\\nThe shipper account number is the sender\\'s account number with the small parcel carrier. You can store this number in the SAP System in one of the following ways:\\n\\nDefine an external account number in the small parcel carrier cockpit. This number is automatically included as identification every time an RFC is carried out.\\n\\nDefine an external account number with the vendor for each company code. If a delivery is made up of orders from various company codes, the number cannot be uniquely defined.\\n\\nEnter the predefined function module XSI_GET_SHIPPER_ACCOUNT in the Shipper account number field so that the system determines an external account number.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the shipper account number is always the same, use the XSI_GET_SHIPPER_ACCOUNT_DEF function module.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the shipper account number is different for one shipping point, maintain the standard value for the Shipper account number data field in Shipping point: meta data.\\n\\nYou can change the shipper account number manually in the delivery, provided you have flagged the field as able to be changed manually.\\n\\nThe qualifier for external communication must have SHIPACCT as its value.\\n\\nService codes\\n\\nThe service code specifies when the goods are to arrive at the customer\\'s place of business (same day or next day, for example).\\n\\nYou need to make a setting for the Service code data field so that the system knows how to find the service code.

You can upload routing information from the small parcel carrier via an XML-enabled Remote Function Call (RFC) interface from the small parcel carrier cockpit.\\n\\nThe qualifier for external communication must have ROUTECODE as its value. The XSI_GET_CARRIER_ROUTING function module finds the corresponding information.\\n\\nParcel tracking number\\n\\nThe parcel tracking number uniquely identifies a parcel or delivery and its shipper account number.\\n\\nThe following two procedures are normally used to create parcel tracking numbers:\\n\\nUnique number originating from number range assignment by the small parcel carrier There is a number range interface available for this purpose.\\n\\nUnique number resulting from incorporation with the shipper account number\\n\\nSome small parcel carriers also store other information such as product code or service code in the parcel tracking number.\\n\\nThe last digit is normally a check digit. Some of the major small parcel carriers program some check digit procedures into function module XSI_CHECK_DIGIT_nn. Since most procedures follow the same formula (digit weighting +/- value of modulo n), it is relatively simple to copy an existing routine and make the appropriate changes if you do not find another procedure that meets your needs.\\n\\nYou can also specify sequence numbers by way of an internal number range.\\n\\nYou can use variable substitution to create parcel tracking numbers when you are dealing with compound parcel tracking numbers (UPS tracking numbers, FedEx Astra codes or German Post Identcode, for example).\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n153\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaster Data\\n\\nYou still have the option of copying the tracking number (or any other data field) from an external server such as FedEx OnSite Server, for example.\\n\\nThe qualifier for external communication must have TRACKN as its value.\\n\\nInternet sites (URLs)\\n\\nYou can store the following URLs in the system for each small parcel carrier:\\n\\nURL for the small parcel carrier\\'s documentation (editing meta data, for example)\\n\\nTarget URL for the SAP Business Connector\\n\\nSample URL for the small parcel carrier\\'s parcel tracking page\\n\\nOther data fields\\n\\nYou can define as many data fields as you like.\\n\\nYou must enter a qualifier for external communication in the definition of the data field so that the field appears in IDocs and the transaction data interface.\\n\\n154\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nEditing Express Delivery Company Data in the Delivery\\n\\nEditing Express Delivery Company Data in the Delivery\\n\\nUse\\n\\nNormally, all data necessary for parcel tracking is automatically determined when you create or save a delivery.

Labels should meet the specifications of each small parcel carrier so that parcels can go through these machines without having to be re-labeled.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nThere are two output types that are predefined for label printing.\\n\\nKEP2, for printing all labels in a delivery\\n\\nKEP6 for printing one label in a shipping unit\\n\\nThere are no label forms defined.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nThere are no specific small package carrier forms available in the SAP System. You have to upload these forms according to a certain procedure (see also: Printing Labels [Ext.]).\\n\\nTo set up labels for small parcel carriers, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Enter the names of the forms in the small parcel carrier cockpit for each small parcel carrier.\\n\\n2. Add access sequence 0013 to the output determination procedure you are using.\\n\\nIf you need various forms, you must\\n\\neither write your own print program (copy SDPACKD2 or SDPACKD3 and adapt FINDFORM)\\n\\nor define new output types\\n\\n156\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nAccess Delivery Tracking Status\\n\\nAccess Delivery Tracking Status\\n\\nUse\\n\\nYou can access information about the current location and status of parcels or deliveries en route to customers via the Internet directly from the small parcel carrier.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\n1. For outbound deliveries, start at shipping [Ext.] and choose Tracking and for inbound deliveries, start at Inbound delivery [Ext.] and choose Tracking.\\n\\n2. Enter the document number on the selection screen and choose Display. You can select according to the following documents:\\n\\n− Sales document\\n\\n− Purchasing document\\n\\n− Delivery\\n\\n− Shipment number\\n\\n− Shipping unit\\n\\n− Tracking number\\n\\nA hierarchical list appears that includes all documents that meet the selection criteria you specified together with their delivery tracking status.\\n\\n3. From this overview screen, you can:\\n\\n− Get delivery tracking data from the small parcel carrier (→ Refresh tracking data)\\n\\nIn the small parcel carrier cockpit, you can make a setting to update this status automatically each time you call up this screen.\\n\\n− Display the small parcel carrier\\'s delivery tracking page on the Internet ( → Internet\\n\\ndelivery tracking)\\n\\n− Display the name of the recipient, point of destination, and the recipient\\'s signature\\n\\n(optional) by using the context menu\\n\\n− Go to and display the corresponding document\\n\\n− Set the tracking status\\n\\nIn the small parcel carrier cockpit, you can indicate whether the status can be set manually.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n157\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProof of Delivery\\n\\nProof of Delivery\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nProof of delivery (POD) is an instrument involved in business processes in which an invoice is issued only after the customer has confirmed the delivery\\'s arrival. In addition to the proof of delivery itself, you can also record the POD date, POD time, the actual quantity that arrived and the reason for possible differences in quantities. This is especially important for deliveries in which the delivery quantity varies because of the nature of the goods or for which the exact delivery quantity is unknown from the start.\\n\\nYou are now in a position to issue an accurate invoice based on the customer\\'s confirmation of goods received. It is no longer necessary to create credit memos after the fact. The reasons for deviation that occur most often in \"real world\" scenarios such as stock shrinkage, theft, certain characteristics of goods (volatility, for example) and transportation damage are recorded and analyzed in the system. This analysis is especially valuable when you are negotiating with forwarding agents, vendors or customers, since all deviations can be reflected.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nProof of delivery is exclusively an instrument for confirmation of external customers\\' deliveries.\\n\\nProof of delivery uses IDOC DELVRY03, although if deviations occur, the delivery proof segment (E1EDL53) in delivery item E1EDL24 and the segments in delivery header E1EDL20 must be filled in. In this segment, the ship-to party enters the deviation reason, the deviation quantity and the delivery unit or stockkeeping unit and the corresponding unit of measure. Proof of delivery is carried out once for the entire delivery. If there are no deviations, you must fill in segments E1EDL20 and E1EDL24.\\n\\nFor batch split items, proof of delivery occurs only for the sub-items, because the given batch is needed for informational purposes. The main batch item is confirmed with no deviations.\\n\\nYou should make the following settings in the Implementation Guide under Logistics Execution →=Shipping → Deliveries → Proof of delivery:\\n\\nDefine for each delivery item category whether it is relevant for the POD process. Flag all item categories that belong to a delivery type as being POD relevant (SAP suggestion).\\n\\nDefine reasons for deviation.\\n\\nSet the Relevant for POD indicator on the Shipping tab page of the customer with whom you would like to carry out POD-processing in the Sales area data of that customer\\'s file.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nAutomatic Verification and Confirmation\\n\\nThe ship-to party transfers the proof of delivery in IDoc format into the SAP System. In this way, the quantities are confirmed once for the entire delivery. The current proof of delivery situation is reflected by the POD status: POD-relevant, Deviations reported or Confirmed.\\n\\nYou can check the POD status at any time within delivery processing by using the status overview. The system does not make an entry in the document flow.\\n\\n158\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nProof of Delivery\\n\\nIn most cases, there are no quantity deviations, meaning that the proof of delivery process does not create any additional work for you. This process enables automatic verification and confirmation via IDoc.\\n\\nManual Verification Processing\\n\\nManual processing of the verification is always necessary when deviations are reported by the ship-to party. In such a case, it is necessary to edit the POD confirmation.\\n\\nWhen you process a POD manually, you can enter and analyze reported differences and deviation reasons in the SAP System. In this way, you can control the checks made and dictate when the POD is ready to be released for further processing. To process proof of delivery manually, proceed as described under Confirming Proof of Delivery Manually [Page 160].\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n159\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nManually Confirming Proof of Delivery (POD)\\n\\nManually Confirming Proof of Delivery (POD)\\n\\n1.

The data you enter can be saved at any time.\\n\\n4. Confirm the verified differences and deviation reasons by choosing Confirm proof of delivery.\\n\\nYou can confirm the POD either immediately or later on. POD can be confirmed in each individual document (as explained above) or for multiple deliveries directly from the worklist. Only after confirmation has been completed can you initiate subsequent processing caused by differences that occurred or creation of a billing document with an adjusted POD quantity. You may not create billing documents using the billing due list until the POD confirmation has been completed.\\n\\nIf you want to cancel a confirmation, choose Cancel proof of delivery. Then, you can change the difference quantities and reasons and re-confirm, if necessary. You can only cancel the POD confirmation if billing documents have not yet been created and if no subsequent processing steps for value or quantity correction have been taken. Therefore, you have the option of changing or adding to quantities or deviation reasons after confirmation is officially completed.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n161\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nSubsequent Processing of Proof of Delivery (POD)\\n\\nSubsequent Processing of Proof of Delivery (POD)\\n\\nUse\\n\\nAfter proof of delivery has been confirmed, the system creates a worklist for manual subsequent processing for necessary quantity and value corrections (cost of sales, for example). You can select from this list according to various criteria (reason for variance, POD date, material, to name a few). You can also use this worklist as a tool for statistical analyses.\\n\\nProcedure 1. From shipping [Ext.], choose Proof of delivery →→→→====Worklist POD subsequent processing.\\n\\nThe Proof of delivery: items with difference quantities screen appears.\\n\\nThe selection screen for the POD subsequent processing worklist is divided into two sections:\\n\\n− Choose worklist\\n\\nYou can select your worklist according to variance reason, POD date or POD verification date, for example.\\n\\n− You can use the Selection conditions for further processing to define indicators for\\n\\nsubsequent processing (quantities or values).\\n\\nThe system flags an item with differences for subsequent processing (manual value and quantity corrections) by using two indicators. Both may have the following attributes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'0\\': No subsequent processing necessary (items with differences, POD status B)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'1\\': Subsequent processing necessary (items with differences, POD status C)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'2\\': Subsequent processing completed (manual quantity or value corrections have been made)\\n\\nWithin the list, these three attributes are illustrated with the following icons:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'0\\': Inactive icon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'1\\': Red icon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'2\\': Green icon\\n\\n2. After entering your selection criteria, choose Execute.\\n\\nA list of all items with varying quantities or values appears. You can sort within this list of items according to reasons (for statistical analyses), as an example.\\n\\n3. Based on this worklist, you can carry out any necessary corrections manually.\\n\\nOnce you are finished making manual corrections, confirm these steps in the worklist by clicking on the corresponding icon. The colors of the icons in the list will change.

This method allows you to reverse goods issue by creating a returns delivery and then posting goods receipt for it.\\n\\nFor more information about reversing goods issue, refer to the Reversal of Goods Issue [Page 165] section.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nAfter billing the outbound delivery, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Enter a returns order (order type RE) for the customer and the material involved.\\n\\nYou can create this returns order with reference to the original sales order. In this way, the document flow assigns the original order to the returns order. The original order quantities for the individual goods are proposed automatically. You can change the proposed quantities if necessary.\\n\\n2. Create a returns delivery for the returns order. The system proposes the delivery type. The delivery quantities in the returns delivery must correspond to the goods issue quantities in the goods issue document that was posted incorrectly.\\n\\n3. Post \"goods issue\" for the returns delivery. The system automatically recognizes the returns delivery as goods receipt and clears the original goods issue posting by carrying out the reverse posting. To post this goods receipt, proceed as if it were actually a Goods Issue Posting [Page 140]. Invoice the business transaction with a returns credit memo. The system automatically proposes the billing type. The original billing document for the goods issue document that was incorrectly posted is cleared by this credit memo.\\n\\n164\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nGoods Issue Reversal\\n\\nGoods Issue Reversal\\n\\nUse\\n\\nGoods issue reversal means that you cancel the goods issue posting for a delivery. This function enables you to remove the posting without having to create a returns delivery and then having to post a goods receipt for it (see also Processing Returns After Goods Issue Posting [Page 164]). This function can be especially useful if you have accidentally posted goods issue, for example, and you would like to reverse it. Goods issue reversal usually occurs shortly after goods issue posting.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe cancellation document is integrated in the document flow of the delivery.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nGoods issue reversal is only possible for movement types for which a reversal movement type is defined in Customizing. Therefore, if you have defined your own movement types for goods issue, you must also define the respective reversal movement types and assign them to the movement types for goods issue.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nWhen you reverse goods issue for a delivery, the system creates a cancellation document that adopts the quantities and the valuation from the original goods issue document, and also executes the respective value and quantity posting to stock.\\n\\nLike the goods issue posting, the goods issue reversal [Page 166] is only possible for the entire delivery. You cannot reverse goods issue for only part of a delivery.\\n\\nAfter the reversal, the goods movement/goods issue status of the delivery is reset to Not yet started. In this way, the delivery can be processed further as required. The system also resets the delivery requirements.\\n\\nIf the delivery has already been billed partially or fully, the goods issue reversal is only possible after the billing document has been cancelled.\\n\\nOnce you implement a decentralized Warehouse Management System [Ext.], you can no longer reverse goods issue that has already been posted.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n165\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nReversal of Goods Issue\\n\\nReversal of Goods Issue\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nFor goods issue reversal, you can only select deliveries that have not yet been billed fully or partially, or whose billing has been cancelled.\\n\\nProcedure 1.

Enter your selection criteria, for example, route, goods issue date, shipping point, and so on, and choose Execute.\\n\\nA list of all deliveries that correspond to your selection criteria appears.\\n\\nFrom the list of deliveries to be reversed, you can branch directly to a list entry in the delivery by double clicking on the entry.\\n\\n3. Select the deliveries for which you wish to reverse goods issue and choose Cancel/reverse.\\n\\nA dialog box appears.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIn the dialog box, confirm that you want to reverse goods issue.\\n\\nResult\\n\\nThe system reverses goods issue for all selected deliveries. It also generates a log of all the reversals executed and any errors that may have occurred.\\n\\n166\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nPrinting and Communication in Shipping\\n\\nPrinting and Communication in Shipping\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n167\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping Output\\n\\nShipping Output\\n\\nUse\\n\\nFrom shipping [Ext.], you can request different shipping outputs using menu option Communication / Printing.\\n\\nYou can request the following output:\\n\\nOutbound delivery output [Page 169]\\n\\n(includes delivery note LD00, packing list PL00 or shipping notification LAVA, for example)\\n\\nLoading output [Page 171]\\n\\n(freight list LD00, for example)\\n\\nShipping unit output [Page 173]\\n\\nThe procedures are similar, although the selection screens vary slightly.\\n\\n168\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nEditing Outbound Delivery Output\\n\\nEditing Outbound Delivery Output\\n\\nTo call up delivery output, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

Here, the EDI output is used mostly for external communication, and ALE output for internal communication. In the standard system, the following outputs are defined:\\n\\nSending a shipping notification (DESADV, outbound EDI)\\n\\n\\n\\nInforming the forwarding agent ( CARNOT, outbound EDI)\\n\\nShipping order to warehousing contractor (SHPORD, outbound EDI)\\n\\nShipping confirmation from service agent (SHPCON, inbound EDI)\\n\\nWarehouse order to internal warehouse (WHSORD, outbound ALE)\\n\\nWarehouse verification from internal warehouse (WHSCON, inbound ALE)\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nThe shipping notification is the advance announcement of the delivery at the customer. When the forwarding agent makes this announcement (shipping order), the delivery data is transmitted so that the agent can organize the pickup and delivery of the goods on behalf of the customer.\\n\\nThe shipping order and the shipping confirmation serve to communicate with a warehousing contractor / service agent. The latter supervises the warehouse and is responsible for the delivery. The contractor also either takes care of the delivery himself/herself or commissions a service agent.\\n\\nThe warehouse order and the warehouse verification both serve to connect a company\\'s own external system (external software) with Warehouse Management.\\n\\nThe following overview shows the output flow:\\n\\nShpgNotif.\\n\\nShipping order\\n\\nCust.\\n\\nVendor\\n\\nFwdAgnt\\n\\nWhse order\\n\\nWarehouse verification\\n\\nShipping order\\n\\nShipping confirmation\\n\\nWhse\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n175\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDelivery Interface\\n\\nAll outputs are based on the basis IDoc type DELVRY01.\\n\\nDelivery header\\n\\nControl\\n\\nDelivery item\\n\\nPartner\\n\\nControl\\n\\nDeadlines\\n\\nSerial numbers\\n\\nTexts\\n\\nBatch features\\n\\nExport\\n\\nExport\\n\\nRoutes\\n\\nReference\\n\\nShipping units\\n\\nTexts\\n\\nDelivery item\\n\\nConfiguration\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOutput that is outbound contains the complete structure, that is, all the fields in the individual segments are supplied with data.\\n\\nIn the case of inbound output, only certain fields in the segments for delivery header, delivery item, and shipping units are used.

Picking verification without flow records.\\n\\nThis type of verification is used if the delivery items in the central system are set in Customizing as non-picking-relevant. The picked quantities are reported by the subsystem to the central system. There, the delivery quantity is adjusted, if allowed. In the IDoc, the following fields must have data:\\n\\nE1EDL20-VBELN\\n\\nE1EDL24-POSNR\\n\\nE1EDL24-MATNR\\n\\nE1EDL24-LFIMG\\n\\nE1EDL19-QUALF = \\'QUA\\'\\n\\n2.

It describes the type and contents of a shipping unit, and provides all the information in a clear manner and in the form of a bar code. This information:\\n\\nuniquely identifies the shipping unit\\n\\ndescribes the contents of the shipping unit\\n\\ndescribes the packaging of the shipping unit\\n\\nmakes the connection between the delivery and the shipment\\n\\nIn the automobile industry, the material label has a central, logistics meaning. The component supplier sends a shipping notification to the manufacturer through EDI. During this procedure, information on the shipping units is transmitted as well. When the shipping units are marked with a material label, the manufacturer can check the respective materials in goods receipt and thus make this process more efficient with the help of scanners. The material label serves for identification purposes until the shipping unit is unpacked in the warehouse or used up in the production department.\\n\\nThe contents and appearance of the material label for the automobile industry in Western Europe is defined by the Odette code (Organization for Data Exchange by Tele-Transmission in Europe) in the norm Odette Transport Label. The German Automobile Industry Association has, for the most part, adopted this norm in its guidelines manual 4902 Material Tags. In North America, the Automotive Industry Action Group has also set a standard with the Shipping / Part Identification Label.\\n\\nThe Odette and AIAG labels, though different in appearance, serve the same purpose.\\n\\nIn both cases you have a shipping label with information on the packed material.\\n\\nTherefore, we refer to these labels as material labels. Please note that other branches of industry have adopted these standards from the automobile industry. Below you see an example of an Odette Transport Label:\\n\\n182\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nMaterial Label (Material Tag)\\n\\nRECEIVER CAR IND. CORP.

You can use this transaction to select all the shipping units for deliveries or shipments. If you wish to reprint a single label, you can do so by selecting individual shipping units with this transaction.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nThe material label is printed through output control. The condition technique in the output control provides great flexibility with the determination of:\\n\\n\\n\\nthe printout (what)\\n\\n\\n\\nthe layout\\n\\n(how)\\n\\n\\n\\nthe printer (where)\\n\\nThe material label is represented in the system by the output type MALB (material label) within the application for shipping units (V6). The output type is linked in the standard system to the access sequence 0002 that references a condition table with the key Ship-to party and Shipping material.\\n\\nThe material label is printed with the help of a new layout module that meets the standards required for the form and scalability of script and bar code. The standard version includes examples for a Printronix IGP printer.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n183\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaterial Label (Material Tag)\\n\\nA printout is thus only possible if the printer understands the description language IGP. Alternatively, a converter box can perform the conversion from IGP into another description language, such as PCL5. For information on print control, for example, for ZPL, refer to the section Adapting Label Layout [Page 185].\\n\\nThree examples for control of an IGP printer are supplied for the following norms:\\n\\nOdette\\n\\n(ODETTE_1_4)\\n\\nAIAG\\n\\n(AIAG_B3_93)\\n\\nVDA\\n\\n(VDA_4902_4)\\n\\nIf you wish to adapt or expand these examples, or use them as a reference for other labels, you can do so by following the guidelines in the section Adapting Label Layout [Page 185].\\n\\nYou can assign the layout module to the output type and the transmission medium, or directly to the condition record. The assignment in the condition record has a higher priority.\\n\\nA component supplier has mostly American customers.\\n\\nTherefore, the supplier maintains layout module AIAG_B3_93 for output type MALB and transmission medium 1 (print).\\n\\nFor the small number of European customers, the supplier maintains layout module ODETTE_1_4 in the condition records.\\n\\nOf course, this is only possible if the condition table has the ship-to-party in the key (as set in the standard version with access sequence 0002).\\n\\nPrinter Determination via the Shipping Point\\n\\nYou can also store a printer within the condition record. Since the printer and thus also the location are defined and determined through organizational units, the printer can also be determined directly via the shipping point. For this case there is a print parameter for each output type. In the standard version, print parameter 5 is assigned to output type MALB.\\n\\nIf the type and size of the labels are uniform (for example, DIN A5, self-adhesive label) and only the layout varies, maintain under Sales and Distribution → Master Data → Others → Print parameter(s) for output type MALB one label printer for each shipping point.\\n\\nIf the layout varies and therefore different printers are required, you need to execute the following activities:\\n\\n1. Define an expanded condition table\\n\\n(for example, shipping point, ship-to party, and shipping material)\\n\\n2. Assign the expanded condition table via a new access sequence to the output type MALB.\\n\\n3. Maintain the printer within the new condition records.\\n\\n184\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nAdapting Label Layout\\n\\nAdapting Label Layout\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nDirect control of the IGP printer takes place in separate layout modules. If you wish to adapt an existing label layout or define a new one, you need to define a new label layout for the new label.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nTo adapt or define the label layout, you need to define a new layout module. For this you need to be familiar with the ABAP Development Workbench and the control language of the printer used.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nThe interface of the layout module is defined by the respective print program. The program RVADWAHN is assigned as processing program for the material label with the output type MALB and the transmission medium 1.\\n\\nThe following processes are defined in the program RDVWAHN.\\n\\n1. The system reads and aggregates the dependent data for a shipping unit.\\n\\n2. The actual printout takes place.\\n\\nHere certain print parameters are set by the system and the layout module is called up for controlling the printer. The printer, device type, and the label data are transmitted to the layout module. Examples for these layout modules include:\\n\\n−\\n\\n(ODETTE_1_4)\\n\\n−\\n\\n(AIAG_B3_93)\\n\\n−\\n\\n(VDA_4902_4)\\n\\nCreating a New Layout Module\\n\\n1. Copy one of the above layout modules into a new function group.\\n\\nYou must not change the interface of the layout module, that is, the parameters LABEL_PRINTER, PRINTER_TYPE and LABEL_DATA must be kept.\\n\\n2. Make the necessary changes in the source text of the layout module.\\n\\nThe control commands to be used are listed in the printer manual.\\n\\nThe control sequence should, as a rule, be mixed with the data of the label, as they are transmitted in the parameter LABEL_DATA.\\n\\nThe data is transmitted to the printer using the ABAP statement WRITE. For example, with WRITE: / \\'~AF17;*\\' NO-GAP, LABEL_DATA-MATNR NO-GAP, \\'*\\' in IGP, the material number is assigned to the printer variable AF17.\\n\\nYou can specify the device type or the printer to distinguish between the control languages. This is important if you are using printers with different description languages (for example, IGP and ZPL), but printing the same label (for example, Odette Transport Label). In this case, define a common function module as layout module (for example, ZZ_ODETTE) and make a distinction within the function module (it is best if the different\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n185\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nAdapting Label Layout\\n\\ncontrols are separated by different routines, for example ZZ_ODETTE_ZPL and FORM ZZ_ODETTE_IGP).\\n\\nThe label data that are provided by the parameter LABEL_DATA are of key importance. The reference is stored in the repository through the structure VWAHN. The following fields are available:\\n\\nLabel Data of the Structure VWAHN\\n\\nEXIDV\\n\\nIdentification of the package\\n\\nEXIDE\\n\\nSupplement to identification\\n\\nVHILM\\n\\nShipping material\\n\\nVHMKU Shipping material at customer\\n\\nNTGEW Net weight\\n\\nBRGEW Gross weight\\n\\nGEWEI Weight unit\\n\\nSMGKN SMG ID\\n\\nVEMNG Maximum quantity\\n\\nVEMEH\\n\\nUnit of measure\\n\\nMATNR Material number\\n\\nKDMAT Material number customer\\n\\nCHARG Batch\\n\\nAESKD\\n\\nChange-status customer\\n\\nARKTX\\n\\nMaterial text\\n\\nKUNNR\\n\\nCustomer number\\n\\nKUADR\\n\\nAddress of customer\\n\\nKULAN\\n\\nCountry of customer\\n\\nABLAD\\n\\nUnloading point\\n\\nVBRST\\n\\nPoint of consumption\\n\\nEIKTO\\n\\nIdentification at customer\\n\\nVSTEL\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nVSADR\\n\\nAddress of shipping point\\n\\nVBELN\\n\\nDelivery number\\n\\nLIFEX\\n\\nExternal delivery number\\n\\nTKNUM Shipment number\\n\\nANZPK\\n\\nNumber of uppermost packages in the delivery\\n\\nWADAT Date of goods issue\\n\\n186\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nAdapting Label Layout\\n\\nThe fields are only filled if the data is unique.

To monitor and optimize the processes and operations in shipping, you can analyze them using the following questions:\\n\\nWhich deliveries are pending for goods issue?\\n\\nWhich deliveries are being processed?\\n\\nFor which materials have the most deliveries been created?\\n\\nWhich inquiries, quotations, and orders are the basis for a particular delivery?\\n\\nWhich deliveries result from which orders?\\n\\nWhich deliveries include certain order items?\\n\\nFor which deliveries do you need to initiate activities in the warehouse?\\n\\nTo determine this and other information, and to execute subsequent activities, you can use the delivery monitor [Page 189].\\n\\nFor example, you can create the following lists with the delivery monitor:\\n\\nLists of deliveries with certain partners\\n\\nLists of deliveries with certain materials\\n\\nLists of deliveries according to specific sales parameters\\n\\nLists of deliveries according to specific shipping parameters\\n\\nYou can specify which fields of the deliveries are to appear in the list and which selection criteria you use, without having to change the settings in Customizing. You can also call up the document flow for individual deliveries.\\n\\nFor further information, see the Reports and Analyses (SD) [Ext.] section.\\n\\n188\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nWorking with the Delivery Monitor\\n\\nWorking with the Delivery Monitor\\n\\nUse\\n\\nThe delivery monitor is used to display and process completed deliveries and deliveries that are still open. Both inbound and outbound deliveries can be processed using the delivery monitor. Since several functions are performed in the same way for both delivery types, this description will use the general term “delivery”, which covers both types of delivery (inbound and outbound).\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nCustomizing\\n\\nNo Customizing is required for the display variants because these can be maintained on a user- specific basis.\\n\\nTo allow selection using the material, you must, however, activate the material index (in Customizing choose Sales and Distribution → Sales → Lists → Set updating of item index). The material index is already activated in the standard system.\\n\\nTo achieve good performance in the selection of partners, we recommend that you update the partner index (in Customizing choose Sales and Distribution → Sales →Lists → Set updating of partner index. Selection of partners is possible even without index updating, but it then requires a longer runtime.\\n\\nAuthorizations\\n\\nTo be able to work with the delivery monitor, you must have display authorization for the shipping points you want to work with. To process the subsequent functions, you need separate authorizations that are checked every time you call up each function.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nThe delivery monitor is set up as a central transaction for collective processing of deliveries and for obtaining information on general shipping processing. The user can call up deliveries with different statuses in one single list and from there initiate further processing, as required. The following collective processes are available:\\n\\nSelection of deliveries that are due for picking or putaway and creation of transfer orders\\n\\nSelection of deliveries for which picked quantities or putaway stocks need to be confirmed\\n\\nGrouping together of deliveries for which transportation needs to be organized\\n\\nSelection of outbound deliveries that are due for loading\\n\\nCollective processing of deliveries that are due for goods issue or goods receipt\\n\\nYou can create lists of deliveries for collective processing using a number of selection criteria. However, depending on the processing type selected, many of the selection criteria may be preset. With the current functionality, for example, you can also call up selections using additional partners and other sales-specific criteria (delivery type, sales organization, division, and so on). You can store selection criteria that you use often in a selection variant, which can simplify routine work with the delivery monitor.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n189\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWorking with the Delivery Monitor\\n\\nIn addition to collective processing, you have the option of creating a “general” selection of deliveries where you can generate a type of worklist based on delivery- and sales-specific criteria. You can then store these selection criteria in a selection variant.\\n\\nOn the initial screen of the delivery monitor, you can switch between the inbound and the outbound delivery views, or you can activate both views at the same time.

However, as you work with it, the delivery monitor notes the name of the variant you last entered. You can also enter and maintain a selection variant for individual selection types on the initial screen of the delivery monitor. Use Display variants to display or maintain variants. To maintain a variants for selection types on the initial screen, enter the name of the variant you want to maintain and choose the icon in the Maint. column. The standard report variant maintenance function appears.\\n\\nYou can also switch back and fourth between the outbound (Only outbound deliveries) and inbound (Only inbound deliveries) views or activate both views simultaneously (All deliveries).\\n\\nDepending on what you want the worklist to convey, you can select according to the following selection types:\\n\\nOutbound delivery\\n\\nInbound delivery\\n\\nFor picking\\n\\nFor putaway\\n\\nFor confirmation\\n\\nFor confirmation\\n\\nFor loading\\n\\nFor goods issue\\n\\nFor goods receipt\\n\\nFor transportation planning\\n\\nFor transportation planning\\n\\nList outbound deliveries\\n\\nList inbound deliveries\\n\\nSelection Screen\\n\\nDepending on the selection type, search criteria from the following areas may appear:\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nRemark\\n\\nOrganization data\\n\\nDocument editing\\n\\nTime data\\n\\n192\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nPicking data\\n\\nDocument data\\n\\nMaterial data\\n\\nPartner data\\n\\nMore partners\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDefining Selection Criteria\\n\\nYou can enter selection criteria relevant for picking of outbound deliveries in this selection area.\\n\\nIf Only picking without WM is activated, only deliveries picked without Warehouse Management are selected.\\n\\nIf Only WM picking is activated, only deliveries that need Warehouse Management for picking (complete or Lean WM) are selected.\\n\\nYou can decide whether the warehouse number check should be run on header or item level in the delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you choose Check at header level, the system only finds deliveries that have warehouse numbers in the header that meet the selection criteria.\\n\\nFor example, you can search for deliveries that are meant to be processed in a Warehouse Management System (WMS) and therefore refer to a warehouse number in the header.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you choose Check at item level, all deliveries that include at least one item that meets the warehouse number criteria are selected.\\n\\nIf you choose Exclude existing groups in WM, the system selects only those deliveries that are not yet assigned to a group in WM.\\n\\n193\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDefining Selection Criteria\\n\\nDisplay options\\n\\nData for shipment\\n\\nStatus: inbound/outbound deliveries\\n\\n194\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nYou can use this selection field to influence how the deliveries are displayed. Depending on the weight and volume units of the selected deliveries, the system determines a weight and volume unit that can be used uniformly for all deliveries in the list.\\n\\nYou can define which units the deliveries should appear in by using the Display in weight unit and Display in volume unit options.\\n\\nIf you choose Display delivery items, the list appears in the item view. If this field is not selected, the header view appears. You can switch between these two views in the list regardless of whether or not this field is selected on the selection screen.\\n\\nIf you select this option, the selection takes more time. The system does require the item data for some subsequent functions and may read it automatically anyway.\\n\\nBy choosing Display forwarding agent, you can also read data about the forwarding agent associated with the delivery.\\n\\nIf you select this option, the selection takes more time.\\n\\nYou can enter selection criteria for the delivery\\'s processing status here. If you call up the delivery monitor in one of the views from which you want to select deliveries that are still in process, some of the status fields may have defaults that cannot be changed. You can enter other selection criteria (using the following letters) for the fields that are ready for input. • A stands for not processed\\n\\nB stands for partially processed\\n\\nC stands for completely processed\\n\\nThis selection option allows you more flexibility than before for selecting deliveries in specific stages of processing.\\n\\nTo select open deliveries, choose Total goods movement status ≠ C, since completed deliveries have a goods movement status of C.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDefining Selection Criteria\\n\\nBackground processing control\\n\\nIf you call up the delivery monitor using selection type Outbound deliveries for picking, you have the option of creating WM transfer orders for the selected deliveries in the background. You can set the parameters Adopt pick quantity and Select items for background processing on the selection screen.\\n\\nIn the Outbound deliveries for conformation selection type, you can confirm pick orders in the background. You can set the Adopt pick quantity parameter on the selection screen.\\n\\nOutput proposal\\n\\nYou can enter the output type that the system is to use during output processing in the list of deliveries. You can change it again later at any point as you process the list by choosing Settings →=Output selection.\\n\\nIf you enter the delivery note as a default value here, you can issue the delivery note directly for the selected deliveries by selecting Subsequent functions →=Outbound deliv. output.\\n\\nNotes on selecting the worklist\\n\\nDuring the selection criteria check at item level, it follows that a delivery is only selected if at least one of the items meets the selection criteria. If the list is then displayed in item view, only those items that meet the criteria are displayed. The selection criteria entered in a search for deliveries that are in process does not influence the length of time this selection takes, for the most part.\\n\\nIn the List outbound deliveries and List inbound deliveries selection types, the system runs checks of the selection criteria entered and, in some cases, time-consuming search algorithms. You can reduce the search time if you follow these guidelines:\\n\\nWhen selecting outbound deliveries with the List outbound deliveries selection type, specify one or more of the following search criteria:\\n\\nShip-to party\\n\\nSold-to party\\n\\nPartners that have a delivery index\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nGoods movement status ≠ C (open deliveries)\\n\\nDocument number\\n\\nWhen selecting inbound deliveries using the List inbound deliveries selection type, specify the following:\\n\\nVendor\\n\\nExternal delivery note number\\n\\nDocument number\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n195\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nDefining Selection Criteria\\n\\n196\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCalling up List Functions\\n\\nCalling up List Functions You can call up the delivery monitor with a view of outbound deliveries by starting at shipping [Ext.] and choosing Outbound Delivery → Lists and Logs →=Outbound Delivery Monitor.\\n\\nYou can call up the delivery monitor with a view of inbound deliveries by starting at inbound delivery [Ext.] and choosing Inbound Delivery → Lists →=Inbound Delivery Monitor.\\n\\nYou can find general information about List Viewer functions under ABAP List Viewer [Ext.]. The following table lists functions that are more specialized than and contribute to the general List Viewer functions:\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nHeader and item views\\n\\nDisplay variants\\n\\nMenu path List → Header view or List → Item view\\n\\nSettings → Display variant → Administration\\n\\nSettings →=Color grouping\\n\\nWhat you should know\\n\\nThere are two types of lists for each processing option: a header view with delivery header information and an item view that contains delivery item information. You can switch back and fourth between these views. The system may need to read the items from the database each time you switch views, which may take a little time. Display variants are maintained separately for header view, item view and for each processing option. Administration of display variants completely corresponds to the list viewer standard and is independent of Customizing. You can also configure user-specific display variants. You can designate one of the display variants as the default variant for the initial screen. In the item view, you can make a setting that gives every other document a different background color, which increases the clarity of this screen. In other words, all items of one document would have the same background color and those in the following document would have a contrasting background.

The item status appears in an item list; otherwise the header status is displayed. The document flow displays the header or item document flow, depending on the kind of list you were in when you chose this command. The Material master function displays the material master for the materials in each delivery you selected. This function is only available in item lists. It is not active in the header view.\\n\\nCustomer master data\\n\\nThe Customer master data function (valid only for outbound deliveries) takes you to the change mode of the customer master for the customers in the documents you have selected.\\n\\nVendor master data is the corresponding function for inbound deliveries.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n199\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCalling up List Functions\\n\\nAssigned groups\\n\\nYou can use the Assigned groups function (only for outbound deliveries) to display the groups of deliveries that correspond to the outbound deliveries that are selected. You can display the group by double-clicking on the line that contains the group number. When you return to the original list of outbound deliveries, the selected deliveries that belong to a group now appear highlighted in color.\\n\\nLists for different types of selections\\n\\nGenerally, the lists for various selection types have a similar structure. There are two exceptions, however:\\n\\nFor the (outbound or inbound deliveries) For confirmatn selection type, pick orders or putaway orders are also included. The Subsequent functions → Confirm picking or putaway function is only active in this selection type for that reason. Since more than one delivery item can be in one order, and vice versa (there can be more than one order per delivery item) the structure of the list varies. In the header view, you can see only one entry per delivery document number and order. In the item view, there is a delivery item, order and entry per delivery document number. Only delivery items for picking or putaway orders that must be confirmed are selected.\\n\\nThere is a two-level list in the For picking processing type. On the first level, you find the labor required per shipping point and picking date and the details lists for each worklist. If you double-click on the daily workload line (marked in violet), a single list appears. You can select the deliveries or delivery items by going to the single list and then returning to the overview list.\\n\\n200\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCarrying out Subsequent Processing\\n\\nCarrying out Subsequent Processing\\n\\nUse\\n\\nSome subsequent processing functions call up other transactions in the batch input procedure.

As with creation of a transfer order, the color of the confirmation indicates its status. If you have set processing of subsequent functions to background mode, you can specify whether the picking or putaway quantity should be copied into the delivery quantity or whether you want to post goods issue/goods receipt immediately following confirmation.\\n\\nYou can set the actual goods movement date.\\n\\nIf the goods issue posting was successful, the processed deliveries appear green; if errors occurred, they appear red. The delivery also appears in green if goods issue was already posted for the delivery in question (because the same delivery was accidentally selected twice, for example).\\n\\nThe procedure is similar to posting goods issue.

When a delivery for a sales order is created, the batch is copied to the delivery. If no batch was entered in the sales order, you can enter it in the Picking Overview screen in the delivery.\\n\\nFor additional information on working with batches in deliveries, see:\\n\\nExecuting Batch Splits in Deliveries [Page 208]\\n\\nTransferring Batch Data from Deliveries into Warehouse Management [Page 209]\\n\\nFor more detailed information on batches in general, see LO Batch Management.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n207\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nExecuting Batch Splits in Deliveries\\n\\nExecuting Batch Splits in Deliveries Batch split describes the situation when you want to specify quantities from more than one batch for a particular delivery item. The batch split function in the delivery includes a batch selection screen and an availability check. In addition, batch processing is linked to the SAP Classification System, enabling you to select batches according to classes and characteristics. For more information about the Classification System, see the CA Classification System [Ext.] documentation.\\n\\nMaster data\\n\\nIn Materials Management (MM), you can specify basic data for each batch, such as Available from and Expiry dates, and data about the origin of the batch.

If you do not specify batch numbers for a batch-relevant material, MM-WM automatically determines batches based on the date of goods receipt. The oldest batch is selected first. If discrepancies occur between the picked quantities and the delivery quantities, the procedure is exactly the same as for deliveries without batches.\\n\\nFor further information on processing data from MM-WM, see the MM-WM Warehouse Management Guide as well as the Individual Picking List [Page 80] section.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n209\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWorking with Material Determination in Deliveries\\n\\nWorking with Material Determination in Deliveries Material determination can be carried out in deliveries for newly entered items.

For example, if you create a listing of products for an individual customer, the customer may only order products on the list. You can also specify material exclusion for a particular customer. The customer may not order excluded materials from you.\\n\\nMaterial listing and exclusion cannot be carried out for delivery items that have been copied from sales documents.\\n\\nDependence on Sales Document Type\\n\\nMaterial listing and exclusion in deliveries are dependent upon the document type of the underlying sales documents. If material listing and exclusion are activated in Customizing for the respective sales document type, they will also be carried out for newly entered items in deliveries that have been created from sales documents.\\n\\nFor deliveries not created with reference to an order, material listing and exclusion are activated in Customizing using the sales document type DL (delivery w/o order).\\n\\nPartner Functions in Material Listing\\n\\nIn sales documents, material listing refers to two partner functions: the sold-to party and the payer. For more information about partner functions, see the R/3 SD online guide on Basic Functions and Master Data. As the payer partner function is not defined for deliveries in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System, you can only check here for the sold-to party whether a material listing exists. For further information on the partner roles, refer to the section Customers and Business Partners [Ext.].\\n\\nMaintaining Master Data\\n\\nYou can control material listing and material exclusion by creating specific types of condition records. You determine in condition records which materials can be ordered by a certain customer and which materials are barred to this customer.\\n\\nFor additional information on material listing and exclusion, see the section Material Listing and Exclusion [Ext.].\\n\\n212\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nWorking with Replenishment Deliveries\\n\\nWorking with Replenishment Deliveries\\n\\nImplementation Options\\n\\nStock transfer involves the withdrawal of goods from the storage location at which they are currently stocked, and the placement into storage of these same goods at another location. Stock transfer may occur within one plant or between two different plants. Stock transfer may be necessary, for example, if the stock at the picking location has been exhausted and needs to be replenished from the inventory stock warehouse.\\n\\nBy making the appropriate setting in Customizing for Purchasing, you can process a stock transfer between two plants as a replenishment delivery in shipping. This is triggered by a stock transfer order in the purchasing department of the receiving plant.\\n\\nProcess Flow\\n\\nThe following steps are necessary to carry out stock transfer with a stock transfer order involving shipping processing:\\n\\n1. Creating stock transfer orders [Page 215]\\n\\nThe stock transfer order serves as a planning tool for goods movement. The process of stock transfer is initiated by a stock transfer order in the plant requiring the goods (receiving plant). If the stock transfer transaction involves shipping processing, the stock transfer order initiates the creation of an appropriate delivery in the supplying plant.\\n\\n2. Creating Replenishment Deliveries [Page 216]\\n\\nIn the delivery due list for the supplying plant, a replenishment delivery is created with reference to the stock transfer order. It is processed like an ordinary delivery.\\n\\n3. Goods issue in supplying plant\\n\\nGoods issue posting for replenishment deliveries triggers goods issue in the supplying plant as well as the respective goods posting to the stock in transit of the receiving plant. The stock in transit is valuated but is not considered unrestricted-use stock.\\n\\n4. Goods receipt in the receiving plant\\n\\nWhen the goods arrive at the receiving plant, the goods receipt posting triggers the posting of the goods from the stock in transit to the unrestricted-use stock for this plant. At the same time the open purchase order quantity is reduced.\\n\\nThe following figure illustrates the stock transfer process involving shipping processing.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n213\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nWorking with Replenishment Deliveries\\n\\nPlant 1\\n\\nPurchasing\\n\\nStock transfer order\\n\\nGoods receipt\\n\\n214\\n\\nPlant 2\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nShipping Shipping worklist worklist\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCreating Stock Transport Orders\\n\\nCreating Stock Transport Orders To create a stock transport order, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

Define and construct the worklist by using the selection options.\\n\\nThe system then lists the documents that meet your selection criteria. (see also: Collective processing of documents due for delivery [Page 58])\\n\\nFrom this list, you can then create the appropriate deliveries and process them as usual. Goods issue posting for the deliveries concludes processing in the supplying plant.\\n\\nPurchase Order History\\n\\nA purchase order (PO) history record is automatically created in Purchasing for the replenishment deliveries and the goods issue posting.

You have the following setting options at your disposal in Customizing:\\n\\nEquipment is mandatory\\n\\nEquipment is not mandatory\\n\\nEquipment is Mandatory\\n\\nIf you specify in a serial number profile that equipment is mandatory, the system, during delivery processing, automatically sets the equipment indicator in the serial number dialog box. When you save the delivery, the system automatically creates corresponding equipment master records for each object where equipment is indicated as mandatory.\\n\\nEquipment not Mandatory\\n\\nIf equipment is not mandatory for a particular material, the system does not automatically create equipment master records.\\n\\nIt is still possible, however, to set the equipment indicator in the serial number dialog box during delivery processing. To do this, mark the corresponding serial numbers and press Create equipment. The system sets the indicator for the serial numbers you selected. When you save the delivery, the system automatically creates equipment master records for the selected serial numbers.\\n\\nIf you set the equipment indicator manually, you can also delete the indicator. To do this, mark the corresponding serial numbers and select Delete equipment.

You can set the quality check function in the material master using QM inspection data.\\n\\nFurthermore, you can specify additional data for deliveries to a customer using a customer- or material-dependent control. This could include, for instance, whether or not agreement from the quality assurance department is required before delivery. To do this, create customer-specific information records in the QM Module. Proceed as follows:\\n\\nIn the screen Quality Planning in Sales and Distribution [Ext.] choose Control QM in SD →→→→====Create.\\n\\nYou see the Create QM Control Data in SD screen where you can create information records.\\n\\nIf a delivery item is divided into several partial items using batch split, the partial items generate partial lots for materials requiring inspection. For every partial lot, an individual sample calculation is run, the results of the inspection are recorded and a decision is made on how they will be used.\\n\\nFor additional information on inspection lots in deliveries, see the QM documentation.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n223\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWorking with Route Schedules\\n\\nWorking with Route Schedules\\n\\nUse\\n\\nUsing a route schedule, you can control periodic customer deliveries of a particular shipping point to different ship-to parties (for example, customers or stores) in a certain sequence on a certain defined route. The planning is based on calendar weeks. The period unit is a day. Also, route schedules have a goods issue time.\\n\\nThe route schedule function supports the following processes:\\n\\nPeriodic deliveries from a shipping point to stores or customers are planned in advance on the basis of calendar weeks and weekdays, also without reference to particular deliveries.\\n\\nYou adapt the schedules in the specific cases to the planning. For example, you can plan a GI date for a Monday at 8 o’clock, without knowing the exact date or the delivery.\\n\\nOn the basis of this planning, deliveries that are to leave the warehouse at the same time are combined into groups. In Shipping you can thus distribute the workload by processing these groups.\\n\\nRoute Schedule South West\\n\\nDep.

In this way, for example, you can choose picking lists on the basis of route schedules.\\n\\nYou can create route schedules for the following documents:\\n\\nSales orders\\n\\nStock transfer orders\\n\\nDeliveries that are based on sales orders, store orders, stock allocations, stock transfer orders, and deliveries without reference.\\n\\nThe route schedule is displayed in the header data of the delivery. For each delivery within the route, the system prints the expected date and the expected time of the delivery (on the basis of the local time at the original shipping point) on the delivery note; the goods issue date is used for the goods issue posting and the stock valuation.\\n\\nIn Customizing, you define for each shipping point, delivery type, stock transfer order, and order type whether or not route schedules are to be used.\\n\\nYou create the route schedules in the master data for shipping. Here you define the route schedule determination and the validity period for the route schedule and the itinerary.\\n\\nAs soon as the legs have been defined, you can branch to another screen to determine the actual itinerary, as well as the time (days/hours/minutes) required to get from one unloading point to the next. In this screen there is a field beside each leg. Here you can enter the number of the itinerary for the individual legs of the route. If, for example, you enter legs A and B, but assign itinerary number 2 and 1 to these, B is the first unloading point on this route. If you press Enter, the legs are displayed in the correct sequence.\\n\\nAt the same time it is possible to control the route schedule determination for each delivery type, stock transfer order, and order type. It is activated in the same manner as the repeated route determination. If the route schedule determination for a delivery is active, the system automatically attempts, during creation or change of a delivery, to determine a route schedule and records this in the delivery. Simultaneously, the scheduling is adjusted. All the deadlines, for example, the transportation planning time, the picking time, the loading time, the goods issue time, and the delivery time can change.\\n\\nDeliveries with the same route schedule and the same date can be selected for the same picking run and the same goods issue. The same procedure can be used for printing delivery notes and freight lists, for the grouping of deliveries into shipments, and for confirmation of picking orders.\\n\\nDeliveries that leave the warehouse at the same time, but are assigned to different routes and can therefore have different route schedules, can be combined together and processed through the creation of wave picks [Page 85]. The only condition is that all deliveries have the same goods issue time.\\n\\nRoute Schedule Determination\\n\\nIf exactly one route schedule is defined for a particular combination of requirements [Page 227], then the system will use this.\\n\\nFor each combination of requirements for the route schedule determination, you can define several route schedules.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n225\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nWorking with Route Schedules\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the case of a delivery without a preceding document, the system determines the route schedule with the earliest delivery time at the ship-to party.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the case of deliveries based on preceding documents (for example, stock transfer orders), the system searches for the route schedule that is nearest to the planned date/time of the delivery. The system uses the following search algorithm:\\n\\n−\\n\\nIf a route schedule exists for the specified time, this is assigned to the delivery.\\n\\n−\\n\\nIf there is no route schedule for the time specified, the system searches for the previous route schedule up to the GI time.\\n\\n−\\n\\nIf there is no route schedule from the GI time to the planned time, the system searches for the next route schedule in the future and assigns this to the delivery.\\n\\n226\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nRequirements for Route Schedules\\n\\nRequirements for Route Schedules The route schedules are determined by the following conditions:\\n\\n\\n\\nShipping point\\n\\nWhere are the goods coming from?\\n\\nShip-to party and unloading point\\n\\nWhere are the goods going to?\\n\\nShipping condition\\n\\nHow are the goods being shipped?\\n\\nTransportation group\\n\\nWhich goods are shipped?\\n\\n→ For example, which type of goods?\\n\\nCalendar week / year\\n\\nWhen are the goods to be shipped?\\n\\nIf you do not explicitly enter the week and the year, the entry applies for each calendar week.

These delivery rhythms have an influence on the workload in the warehouse. To help delivery planning, the route schedule serves as a tool for planning regular, repetitive customer deliveries on a particular route. At the time of planning, potential deliveries that have not yet been created are grouped in the route schedule. When the deliveries are created, the system can automatically determine a route schedule and assign it to the delivery. All deliveries with the same route schedule and the same date can be processed together in the shipping point. All these deliveries leave the shipping point together at a particular time. They are distributed along the same geographical route.\\n\\nDeliveries for route schedule MO10H leave the shipping on Mondays at 10:00 in the direction of Philadelphia.\\n\\nDeliveries for route schedule MO10M leave the shipping point on Mondays at 10:00 in the direction of Boston.\\n\\nDeliveries for route schedule MO10S leave the shipping point on Mondays at 10:00 in the direction of New York.\\n\\nYou can print picking lists for all deliveries that belong to route schedules MO10H - MO10S together.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to define route schedules, you must perform the following tasks:\\n\\n− Activate the route determination\\n\\n− Activate the delivery scheduling\\n\\n− Activate the route schedule for your shipping point and make the following settings:\\n\\nTransaction\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nDelivery Sales order Stock transfer order Route schedule determination for delivery type\\n\\nRoute schedule determination for delivery type Route schedule determination for sales document type\\n\\nSet delivering plant and order type\\n\\nMaintenance of the itinerary should be uniform for all the route schedules used. To ensure exact planning, maintain the itinerary for all the route schedules. If rough planning is sufficient in this case, you do not need to maintain the itinerary for a route schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do not define any goods accepted times in the customer master for the unloading points of the ship-to party, the system assumes that the goods acceptance is possible at any time. The system determines the delivery time from the departure time in the route schedule plus the required traveling time to the ship-to party, as set in the itinerary (specific move time).

Data is automatically transferred between the R/2 system in which sales processing and billing take place and the R/3 Decentralized Shipping module. In this way, you can make use of both existing systems and new shipping functions.\\n\\nIt may also be helpful to use the R/2-R/3 link outside of the Sales and Distribution processing environment in the following situations:\\n\\nA sales company is working in cooperation with a supplying company. However, each has its own computing system.\\n\\nVarious software products are to be combined on various hardware platforms.\\n\\nRange of Functions\\n\\nIn the central R/2 Sales and Distribution system, you create sales orders and then create deliveries with reference to those orders. At this point, an availability check and delivery scheduling is carried out. When printing is initiated, the delivery data is transferred using CPI-C (interface to enable communication between different programs) to the R/3 Shipping System.\\n\\nThe R/3 Shipping System creates deliveries without an order reference using the delivery data it receives in the form of communication documents [Page 236]. After the deliveries have been processed, the transfer of delivery data back to the central R/2 sales and distribution system is initiated by a pro forma goods issue posting.\\n\\nIn the central R/2 Sales and Distribution system, the goods issue posting and billing are now executed for the deliveries it has received.\\n\\nThe goods issue posting in the R/3 Shipping System serves to initiate the transfer of delivery data back to the central sales and distribution system. The actual goods issue posting that passes the data on to Materials Management is carried out by the central R/2 Sales and Distribution system once the delivery data becomes available there.\\n\\nThe following figure illustrates the procedure in the R/2-R/3 link from the point of view of the central R/2 Sales and Distribution system and the decentralized R/3 Shipping system.\\n\\n234\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nIncoming order Availability check Delivery scheduling\\n\\nTriggers shipping\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nR/2 Sales and Distribution\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nGoods issue\\n\\nBilling\\n\\nShipping instructions\\n\\nReturn message\\n\\nR/3 Shipping\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\nProcess delivery\\n\\nPick\\n\\nWeigh / pack\\n\\nCreate shipping documents\\n\\nConfirm physical goods issue\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nR/2-R/3 Link\\n\\n235\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nCommunication Terms\\n\\nCommunication Terms For the communication process between central and decentralized systems in the R/2-R/3 link, various communication elements are required to make data transfer and the checking of transfer transactions possible.\\n\\nCommunication Document\\n\\nA central element of the communication process is the communication document. A communication document is created for each data transfer transaction between the systems.\\n\\nA communication document is a data chain transferred in one transaction. It consists of communication records with the same number. The first and the last record of the communication document are marked. Thus, a communication document can be seen as a logical unit as such.\\n\\nCommunication Record\\n\\nA communication record is a data extract in R/3 format consisting of the data to be transferred.\\n\\nRecord Type\\n\\nSince different data has to be transferred, depending on the transaction and the direction of the communication process, communication records are assigned to specific record types.\\n\\nRecord Identification\\n\\nA communication record is identified by a record type and a record number. Communication records with the same record number form a communication document, regardless of the record type.\\n\\nData Structure\\n\\nThe structure of a communication record is stored in R/3 format in the Data Dictionary and is dependent on the record type. A specific table, where the respective communication records are stored, is defined for each record type.\\n\\nR/3 Format\\n\\nCommunication records are always transferred in R/3 format, regardless of the direction of the communication process. Thus, the recipient is always responsible for the conversion. Therefore, it does not make any difference for the R/2-R/3 link which system is operating as the partner system (R/2 host, non-SAP host).\\n\\nCommunication Records Status\\n\\nTo enable a communication chain to be created, the communication records are given a record status that determines their position within the communication document during the technical transfer process.\\n\\nThe following table lists possible statuses:\\n\\nCommunication Records Status\\n\\nStatus for...\\n\\nImportance\\n\\nF D\\n\\nFirst Last\\n\\nFirst record of communication document Last record of a communication document\\n\\n236\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nCommunication Terms\\n\\nblank S\\n\\nOther record of communication document\\n\\nSingle Communication document consists of 1 record\\n\\nCommunication Number\\n\\nWhen the system recognizes during a transaction that a communication document must be created, it determines a communication number based on the recipient.\\n\\nThe communication number is the technical definition of the recipient (target system, application, client, receiving program etc.). The communication number is used to determine the key for the queue file.\\n\\nQueue\\n\\nIn a queue, communication records to be transferred are stored in an intermediate file before the transfer takes place.\\n\\nThe communication documents can be sent automatically or manually from the intermediate file to the partner system.\\n\\nSend Program\\n\\nAt the time of data transfer a send program is called up that\\n\\n\\n\\ncreates the communication document\\n\\nwrites the communication document to the intermediate file\\n\\nDuring an automatic transfer, the program carries out the following functions:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt establishes a connection to the receiving program in the target system.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt transfers the communication documents using CPI-C.\\n\\nReceiving Program\\n\\nIn the receiving system the communication document is processed by the receiving program. The receiving program has the following functions:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt writes the individual communication records to the tables defined for the specific record types.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt creates a status record that you can use to check the communication process.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt tests the data contents in the communication records.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt carries out the postings in the receiving system.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n237\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nProcessing communication documents\\n\\nProcessing communication documents Usually communication between the central R/2 Sales and Distribution system and the R/3 Shipping System takes place automatically.

You will find the status Completed in the document flow for the decentralized delivery if confirmation has been carried out successfully.\\n\\nProcessing Decentralized Deliveries\\n\\nDecentralized deliveries are edited in the same way as deliveries in a central R/3 System.\\n\\nYou can choose between the following processing types:\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual processing\\n\\nProcessing using delivery due list\\n\\nProcessing by making selections from deliveries in process\\n\\nThe deliveries can be grouped and processed together in the decentralized R/3 System. However, the group data cannot be transferred to the central sales and distribution system.\\n\\nConfirming Decentralized Deliveries Manually\\n\\nTo confirm a decentralized delivery manually, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. From shipping [Ext.], choose Environment →→→→====R/2-R/3 link.\\n\\nYou see the screen R/2-R/3 Link.\\n\\n2. Choose Communication →→→→====Shipping →→→→====Confirm comm.doc.\\n\\nYou see the Selection Program for Issuing Output screen.\\n\\n3. Enter the number of the decentralized delivery that you want to report in the Key field. You can also enter a number interval. You must include the leading zeros when you enter the delivery numbers.\\n\\nDo not change the entries in the remaining fields.\\n\\n4. Choose Program →→→→====Execute.\\n\\nYou receive the message <n> outputs were processed in total.\\n\\nThe decentralized delivery is confirmed in the sales and distribution system.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n243\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaterial Master Transfer\\n\\nMaterial Master Transfer Material master records from a central R/2 system can be transmitted to decentralized R/3 systems and created there automatically in order to enable the R/2-R/3 link. Changes in the material master in the central system can also be transferred automatically to the decentralized R/3 System. The material data transfer is initiated, when a material is created or changed in the central system.\\n\\nYou create or change material master records in the central system. The respective material data is passed on to the decentralized R/3 System using communication documents. The data is then changed or created accordingly in the decentralized system.\\n\\nFor information on processing communication documents for material master data, see the section Processing Communication Documents [Page 238].\\n\\nPlease note that only communication types Material LgO and Material SD are relevant here.\\n\\nThe following figure shows the general procedure for transferring material masters.\\n\\nR/2R/2\\n\\nAdd material master\\n\\nChange material master\\n\\nCommunication document\\n\\nCommunication document\\n\\nR/3R/3\\n\\nAdd material master in background\\n\\nMAIL New material master\\n\\nChange material master in background\\n\\nMaintain material master if necessary\\n\\n244\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nMaterial Master Transfer\\n\\nCreating a Material Master Record\\n\\nWhen a material master record is created in the central system, the following procedure is used to transfer the material master data to a decentralized system:\\n\\n1. The user creates a material master record in the central system (using transaction TJ10 in the R/2 System, for example).\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIf plant data is maintained during creation of the master record, the system checks whether transfer of material master data to a decentralized system has been defined for the plant and whether all required views (for example, Sales/Plant Data or Sales Text) are maintained. If this is the case, the central system creates a communication document containing all relevant material data and sends this document to the decentralized R/3 System.\\n\\n3. Once the required data has arrived, the following actions are carried out in the decentralized R/3 System:\\n\\nThe system creates a new material master record in the background, which includes the following views:\\n\\n– Sales 1\\n\\n– Sales 2\\n\\n– Sales/Plant Data\\n\\n– Sales Text\\n\\n– Storage\\n\\nIf Customizing is set accordingly, the person responsible for maintaining the R/3 material master receives a mail informing him that a new material master record has been created.\\n\\n4. After receiving the mail, the person responsible for the material master can maintain the material master record decentrally, if necessary. However, the extent to which he or she can carry out changes is very limited.\\n\\nThe transfer of material data relevant for the storage location has to be initiated manually in the central R/2 System. All other material data is sent automatically to the decentralized R/3 System. For the data relevant for the storage location, communication records of the type Material Stl and for the other material data communication records of the type Material SD are created.\\n\\nChanging Material Master Records\\n\\nYou always change general material data in the central system. If changes to the material master are carried out in the central system, and these need to be taken into account in the decentralized R/3 System, the changed data is transferred. This is carried out as follows:\\n\\n1. A user changes material data in the central system.\\n\\n2. The central system recognizes that this data needs to be transferred to the decentralized R/3 System and creates a communication document that contains the changed data. The document is sent to the decentralized R/3 System.\\n\\n3. The relevant material data is changed in the decentralized R/3 System.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n245\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nMaterial Master Transfer\\n\\nWhen the material master records are changed, the sending of material data relevant for the storage location also has to be initiated manually in the central R/2 System.\\n\\n246\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nMaterial Master Maintenance\\n\\nMaterial Master Maintenance Since, with few exceptions, material data is maintained in both systems, there has to be a way to ensure that the data remains consistent in both systems. Material data that has been transferred from a central R/2 system cannot, therefore, be changed decentrally.\\n\\nHowever, this does not apply to data that exists independently in the decentralized R/3 System. For example, the transportation group and loading group do not exist in R/2 but are automatically created in the decentralized R/3 System. This data can be changed decentrally because a change does not affect the data consistency of the two systems.\\n\\nChanging Materials Decentrally [Page 248]\\n\\nMaintaining Materials Centrally in the Decentralized System [Page 249]\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n247\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nChanging Materials Decentrally\\n\\nChanging Materials Decentrally To change a material decentrally in the R/3 System, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.

Maintain the material in the usual way.\\n\\nIn the various sales views you can make limited changes only. For reasons mentioned above, the majority of fields are not ready for input.\\n\\nTo ensure data consistency, only the maintenance transaction described above can be used to change materials decentrally.\\n\\n248\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nMaintaining Materials Centrally in the Decentralized System\\n\\nMaintaining Materials Centrally in the Decentralized System When centrally maintained material data is urgently needed in the decentralized R/3 System and the automatic data transfer between the two systems is temporarily not possible, it may be necessary to maintain the relevant views manually in the decentralized system. To do this, the following transactions are available to you in the R/3 System.\\n\\nFor central maintenance only the sales-related views that are necessary for parallel data maintenance in both systems are available to you. On these screens, all relevant fields are ready for input. The Item category group, Transportation group and Loading group fields are not mandatory, since they can subsequently be maintained decentrally.\\n\\nCreating Materials Centrally\\n\\nTo create a material centrally in the decentralized R/3 System, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. From SD master data [Ext.], choose Products →→→→============Material →→→→====R/2-R/3 Link →→→→====Change centrally.\\n\\nYou see the screen Create Material: Initial Screen.\\n\\n2.

Change the material in the usual way.\\n\\nTo guarantee data consistency in both systems it is very important to make sure that, when maintaining centrally, the manually maintained material data in the decentralized R/3 System corresponds exactly to the material data in the central system.\\n\\nMaintenance Authorizations\\n\\nTo prevent material data that has been transferred to the decentralized R/3 System from being changed by unauthorized persons, the maintenance of the various views of the material master record has to be limited through the allocation of authorizations (object M_MATE_STA) by the system administrator.\\n\\nDecember 1999\\n\\n249\\n\\nShipping\\n\\nSAP AG\\n\\nError Detection and Analysis\\n\\nError Detection and Analysis There are three ways in which you can deal with errors that occur during data transfer:\\n\\nSend a mail to the employee responsible for data transfer errors\\n\\nAnalyze the system log\\n\\nEvaluating Communication Documents\\n\\nTo carry out these functions in the system, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIn the Shipping screen [Ext.], choose Delivery →→→→====R/2-R/3 link.\\n\\nYou see the screen R/2-R/3 Link.\\n\\n2.

These might be, for example, different\\ndepartments in a store, bays in a distribution center, or areas in a manufacturing plant.\\nDepartments are assigned to receiving points, which in turn are assigned to unloading points.\\nOne receiving point may have several departments assigned to it, but each department is\\nassigned to only one receiving point. By knowing a department, you can therefore also determine\\nthe receiving point and the unloading point.\\nUsing departments and receiving points enables you to more finely specify the final destination\\nfor a shipment or portions of a shipment, thus reducing the time it takes for the goods to becomeavailable for the receiver’s use or sale.\\n \\nA pallet load of merchandise is delivered to Bay 1 at a department store (unloading\\npoint). The shipment is broken down and delivered to one or more floors (internal\\nreceiving points). From there the packages are delivered to one or moredepartments, such as Housewares, Consumer Electronics, Health & Beauty Aids, orWomen’s Dresses.\\nUse\\n• Sales orders\\nThe receiving point and department are located on the Business Data Detail Shipment\\nscreen, either at the header or item level. If the header contains this information, thisbecomes the default for all items, but you can override it for individual items if you wish.Items in a sales order may have different receiving points and/or departments.\\n• Picking lists and delivery notes\\nYou can print the receiving point and department on picking lists and delivery notes. If\\nthis information was included in the sales order, then it will automatically be inserted inthese other documents; otherwise, you can enter it manually. (However, picking lists and\\ndelivery notes are not split by receiving point or department.)\\n• Billing documents\\nYou can specify that the department and receiving point are to be printed on billing\\ndocuments. You can also specify that invoices are to be split by receiving point and\\ndepartment.\\nIn Customizing for Retail ( Retail    → Central coordination \\n→ Sales → Sales order processing →\\nMaintain promotion/receiving point determination per sales document type ) you can specify for\\neach type of document whether or not automatic department and receiving point determination is\\nto be done.\\nStructure\\nThe department and receiving points are fields in sales orders and delivery notes.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In order to avoid data redundancy, accounting data and sales and distribution data isstored in one master record, the customer master record.\\nA customer master record can be accessed using three different groups of data, which differ in\\nthe level of detail they offer. A master record has the following structure.\\nCompany code\\ndata        Sales and\\nDistribution data    General data\\nGeneral data\\nGeneral data does not depend on the company code, or on your company's organization of sales\\nand distribution. Data on a customer is the same in both views. This includes, for example, the\\ncustomer name, address and telephone number.\\nHowever, general data is not limited to the information which is of importance to both\\ndepartments. The unloading point, for example, which is regarded as general data, is onlyrelevant for sales and distribution. However, since it is not based on the sales and distributionorganization of your company and is always unique for this customer, it is not considered part of\\nthe sales and distribution data.\\nIf you edit a customer master record using only the customer number, without specifying a sales\\nand distribution area or a company code, the system will only display the general data screens.\\nGeneral data is entered by the department which first creates the customer master record for a\\ncustomer. If the sales and distribution department creates the customer master record, it must\\nalso enter the address data. When the accounting department enters accounting data it is then\\nunnecessary for them to enter the general data also. They can use the display function to accessthe general data.\\nCompany Code Data\\nThis data is only of importance to the accounting department. It includes, for example, data oninsurance and account management. Company code data only applies to one company code.\\nIf you edit the customer master record you must specify customer number and company code in\\norder to access the screens containing company code data.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The second method is called external number assignment.\\nIn the case of external number assignment, a number range that allows for alphanumericalnumber assignment can be defined.\\nThe account group determines whether internal or external number assignment is allowed for a\\ncustomer master record. For account groups 0001 to 0005, for example, only internal numberassignment is allowed in the standard version of the SAP R/3 System.\\nNumber Range\\nFor every account group a number range is defined from which a serial number is assignedduring internal number assignment. In the case of external number assignment the systemchecks whether the customer number entered lies within the defined number range.\\nA number range can be valid for different account groups. In the standard version of the SAP R/3\\nSystem the account groups for sold-to party, ship-to party, payer and bill-to party belong to the\\nsame number range so that the numbers for these master records are assigned consecutively.\\nYou can use the number range to assign, for example, different numbers to the head office andthe branches.\\nA customer's number is unique for all sales areas and company codes.

For example, if your customer base includes multi-level buying groups,cooperatives, or chains of retail outlets, you can create hierarchies to reflect the structure ofthese groups. You use customer hierarchies in order and billing document processing for partner\\nand pricing determination (including rebate determination) and for creating statistics.\\nYou can use customer hierarchies to assign price conditions and rebate agreements to one of\\nthe customer’s subordinate levels, to ensure that all subordinate levels are valid for the customer.For each node that you indicate as relevant for pricing, you can create condition records forpricing. If one or more nodes in a hierarchy path for a sales order contain pricing data, this isautomatically taken into account in pricing.\\nIntegration\\nYou can also use customer hierarchies for evaluations in profitability analysis (CO-PA) and in the\\nSales Information System (SIS):\\nTo evaluate customer hierarchies with the sales information system and in the profitability\\nanalysis, you can maintain the field Hierarchy assignment  on the Marketing  tab page in the\\ncustomer master record for a hierarchy customer. Here you can maintain 10 features for\\nhierarchy customers  (HIEZU01 to HIEZU10). You can use these to evaluate hierarchies\\nstatistically with up to 10 levels. (Field catalogue VHIE)\\nNote that the hierarchy assignment is statistical. If you change the customer\\nhierarchy, you may need to change the hierarchy level manually in the customer\\nmaster record in the Hierarchy assignment field.\\nFeatures\\nA customer hierarchy is a flexible structure consisting of customers . Each customer - with the\\nexception of the uppermost customer - refers to another customer at a higher level in the\\nhierarchy (known as a higher-level customer ). Customers that are assigned to higher-level\\ncustomers are known as dependent customers .\\nTo be able to display organizational elements, that are not independent partners, you can assign\\npure hierarchy nodes  (account group 0012) in the hierarchy. Specific data can be assigned to a\\nhierarchy node (for example, address, price conditions, rebate agreements) and this then applies\\nto all subordinate customers.\\nAs all nodes in a hierarchy are time-dependent, you can adapt the customer hierarchy to\\nchanges in the structure of a customer at any time.\\n• Customers can be reassigned in a hierarchy When reassigning a customer, all subordinate\\ncustomers are moved with it\\n• You can add new customers to a hierarchy When you assign a new customer to an existing\\nhierarchy, all pricing data, that applies to the higher-level hierarchy node, is automatically\\ncopied from the customer', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

You can find further information in Creating Customer Master Records.\\nIn the customer master record you can indicate whether the customer is relevant for\\npricing, rebate processing, profitability analysis (CO-PA) or evaluations in the sales\\ninformation system (SIS).\\n2. You create a hierarchy, in which you assign the hierarchy customers for the higher-level\\ncustomer.\\nNormally the sold-to party or goods recipient are assigned to the lowest hierarchy level.\\nYou can, however, also assign a sold-to party to a node, that is at a higher level. For\\nexample, you could assign a particularly large branch of a chain of retail outlets to the\\nregional office instead of to the local office.\\n3. You can maintain the hierarchy at a later date, by\\n• assigning new customers (these customers are automatically assigned a current\\nvalidity date)\\n• reassigning  available customers\\n• changing  the validity period of a customer for the hierarchy\\n• removing  customers, if required, from the hierarchy\\nResult\\nIf you assign a customer in the hierarchy, the system creates a time-dependent\\nassignment  for this customer to the higher-level customer.

The material type represents certain features ofmaterials in the system, and has important control functions: the material type is used, amongother things, to group field selection functions for a material, or to define the screen sequence,\\nthe type of number assignment and number ranges during material master record maintenance.\\nDepending on the material type, company areas maintain different data screens. This screenselection applying specifically to an application is called a \"view\".\\nThe following are examples of possible material types in the SAP standard version:\\n• Trading Goods\\n• Non-stock Material\\n• Services\\n• Packaging Material\\nTrading Goods\\nTrading goods are movable goods intended for commercial exchange. Examples of trading\\ngoods are market goods, consumption goods and durable goods. Trading goods are always\\nbought and re-sold by your company. The material master record for trading goods thereforealways contains purchasing data and sales data. Trading goods are managed in the SAP R/3System using the key HAWA.\\nNon-stock Material\\nNon-stock material includes materials that are not managed on an inventory basis (for example,small parts such as nails) though physically in stock. Non-stock materials are managed in theSAP System using the key NLAG.\\nServices\\nServices are represented and managed in the SAP System as materials. Services are immaterial\\ngoods that differ from other goods, particularly in that their production and consumption coincide.\\nServices are generally regarded as non-transportable and non-stockable. Typical services arecommercial services, transport services, bank and insurance services, goods from culturalorganizations and the mass media, as well as services provided by the public security forces orthe education and health sectors.\\nSince services cannot be stored, a material master record of this material type does not contain\\ninventory data or inventory management data. No fields for gross weight, net weight or unit of\\nweight are included in the basic data for a service, as are for other material types. Services aremanaged in the SAP R/3 System with the key DIEN.\\nPackaging Material\\nThis material type includes all materials needed for packaging.

The groupings are determined and defined by the system administrator.\\nContact him, if you have questions concerning the existing groupings.\\nIn the standard version of the SAP R/3 System the following groupings are possible, for example:\\n• Material Group\\n• Material Pricing Group\\n• Product Hierarchy\\nMaterial Group\\nGoods with the same features (for example, nails) can be grouped using the field Material group.\\nUnlike the product hierarchy, the material group does not contain different levels or possiblecombinations of goods. You can, however, use the material group to carry out different analysisfunctions.\\nThe material group is defined by a nine-digit, alphanumeric key. It is not primarily of importance\\nfor sales and distribution, but is used mainly in materials management.\\nMaterial Pricing Group\\nA further option for grouping materials is represented by the material pricing group. This can be\\nused both for pricing as well as for evaluation and analysis. The material pricing group is definedby a two-digit, numeric key.\\nProduct Hierarchy\\nThe product hierarchy is used to group materials by combining different features. It is used for\\nanalyses and pricing. A product hierarchy can consist of up to eighteen characters. Its features\\ncan be combined in various ways. The following figure gives an example of how materials can begrouped using product hierarchies.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the SAP R/3\\nSystem, you can therefore define various units of measure which are maintained in the sales anddistribution screens. However, you only need to maintain the fields of the units of measure if theydeviate from the base unit of measure. If no other fields with units of measure are maintained, the\\nsystem automatically takes the base unit of measure as a basis for its calculations. You can enter\\nthe following units of measure in the sales and distribution screens:\\n• Base Unit of Measure\\n• Alternative Unit of Measure\\n• Sales Unit\\n• Delivery Unit\\nBase Unit of Measure\\nStocks of a material are managed in the base unit of measure. All quantity movements in other\\nunits of measure are converted automatically by the system into the base unit of measure.\\nAlternative Unit of Measure\\nAs soon as units of measures other than the base unit of measure are used in a material masterrecord, the system prompts you in a dialog box to enter a calculation factor to the base unit ofmeasure, the so-called alternative unit of measure. The alternative unit of measure does not referto an entry field in one of the sales and distribution screens. It is either requested in a dialog box\\nor entered on a secondary screen, which you can access by pressing \\nF5 (Unit of measure) .\\nSeveral alternative units of measure can be defined.\\nIf, for example, a product is managed in the base unit of measure \"Piece\" but is sold in the sales\\nunit \"Box\", you must define the conversion factor. The alternative unit of measure can define, for\\nexample, that 1 box of this material contains 12 pieces.\\nSales Unit\\nThe unit of measure in which materials are sold is referred to as a sales unit (for example, piece\\nor bottle). The value you define in the material master record is proposed during businesstransactions relevant for sales, such as the sales order. You can replace them with otheralternative units of measure in the sales order.\\nDelivery Unit\\nThe delivery unit refers to the unit in which materials can be delivered. Only exact multiples of the\\ndelivery unit can be delivered. For example, with a delivery unit of 30 bottles, 30, 60 or 90 bottles\\ncan be delivered, but not 100 bottles.\\nQuantity Specifications\\nTwo different quantity specifications are used:\\n• Minimum Order Quantity\\n• Minimum Delivery Quantity', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The rest of the goods are free.\\nThis is called Inclusive free goods  and means that part of the purchase quantity is\\ndesignated as free goods and is not billed.\\nThe material supplied as free goods always has the same unit of measure as the\\npurchased quantity.\\nOf ten bottles of wine, two are designated as free goods.

You can also specify the sequence inwhich the materials are to be displayed in the product proposal.\\nDuring sales document processing, the system displays a product proposal in the item overview,\\naccording to the customer and business transaction. It displays the material number, materialdescription and the historical order quantities in the sales unit last used. To use them again, youcan just copy them.\\nThe system does not run the standard checks (pricing, availability, incompleteness, material\\ndetermination, free goods determination, and so on) until you enter the order quantities.\\nThe product proposal acts both as an entry aid and also an aid to sales support and promotions.\\nIt is particularly useful tool in the telephone sales area. During sales document processing thematerials, that are particularly relevant for a particular customer, are displayed to the processor.This enables them to provide appropriate advice to the customer quickly and easily. You can usethe sales document history to analyze the customer's purchasing habits and recognizestraightaway if their behavior changes, for when instance when they suddenly stop ordering a\\nproduct.\\nThe product proposal differs from cross selling in that it is dependent on the customer and sales\\narea, and is therefore displayed in the sales document as soon as you have entered a customer.Cross selling, on the other hand, is triggered by the material. In other words, the systemproposes cross-selling materials according to the material or a characteristic of the material you\\nhave entered.\\nPrerequisites\\nYou must make the following settings in Customizing:\\n• Define the customer pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n• Define the document pricing procedure for the product proposal\\n• Assign the document pricing procedure for the product proposal to sales document types\\n• Maintain the table of origin for the product proposal\\n• Define the procedure for the product proposal and specify the access sequences\\n• Maintain procedure determination (in background) for the product proposal\\n• Maintain procedure determination (online) for the product proposal\\nYou can find these settings in Customizing for Sales and Distribution under Basic Functions .

The system then checks if the business partneris authorized to release against the contract.\\nDepending on the settings in Customizing, the system determines whether a partner is\\nauthorized to release against the contract by checking against one of the following:\\n• Partners in the contract (Rule A)\\nIf the partner has the partner function AG (sold-to party) or AA (sold-to party for release\\norder) in the contract, the system accepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release\\norder.\\n• Partners in the hierarchy (Rule B)\\nIf the partner who wants to release against the contract is the sold-to party of the contract\\nor at a lower level in customer hierarchy to the sold-to party in the contract, the system\\naccepts the partner as the sold-to party for the release order.\\nAfter the authorization check, the system also checks if more than one ship-to party is defined in\\nthe contract. If the contract contains a WE (ship-to party) and several AWs (ship-to party for\\nrelease order), the system lists the possible ship-to parties in a dialog box. You select the\\nappropriate ship-to party for the release order.\\nYou can define authorized sold-to parties (AA) and additional ship-to parties (AW) inthe customer master record. When you create a contract for the customer, thesepartners are proposed for selection.\\nPrerequisites\\nYou activate the partner authorization check in the Customizing activity ‘Define Sales DocumentTypes’.\\nPartner determination procedure KAB (partners in contract) contains the partner functions AA\\nand AW. You must assign this procedure to the sales document types for which the partner\\nauthorization check is relevant. You make this assignment in the Customizing activity ‘Define and\\nassign partner determination procedures’.\\nIn the standard R/3 System, the partner releasing against the contract and the ship-to party\\nwhich you select are copied into the release order. If you want to control which partners arecopied into the release order, you can define a copying routine for the relevant document types in\\nthe Customizing activity ‘Maintain Copying Control for Sales Documents’. For example, you can\\nspecify that only the sold-to party releasing against the contract is copied into the release orderand the other partners are determined from the customer master record of the sold-to party.\\nFeatures\\nIf rule B is defined for the contract type, you can search for authorized partners for a release\\norder using the contract number. Equally, you can search for the relevant contract for a release\\norder using the partner number. In this case, the partner authorization rule is irrelevant.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In order to work with the SAP System your\\ncompany structure  has to be represented in the system. This is done with the help of\\nvarious organizational structures.\\n• In sales and distribution, products are sold or sent to business partners or services are\\nperformed for them. Data about the products and services as well as about the business\\npartners is the basis for sales processing. Sales processing with the SAP R/3 Systemrequires that the master data has been stored in the system.\\nIn addition to sales and distribution, other departments of the company such as\\naccounting or materials management access the master data. The material master datais stored in a specific structure in order to allow access from these different views.\\n• The processing of business transactions in sales and distribution is based on the master\\ndata. In the SAP R/3 System, business transaction are stored in the form of documents.These sales and distribution documents  are structured according to certain criteria so\\nthat all necessary information in the document is stored in a systematic way.',\n",
